2pac,"Why you let the police beat down niggas
I'm startin' to think all the rich in the world is safe"
2pac,"Out here in California, nigga, we warned ya we'll bomb on you motherfuckers
We do our job"
2pac,"I hung around with the thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love"
2pac,"Two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases (Hm)
Bitches, get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down (Biatch)"

Got to be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me"
2pac,"I never meant to cause drama to my sister and mama
Hope we make it to better times, in this white man's world"
2pac,"And gettin' high, on the lookout for my enemies
Don't wanna die, tell me why"
2pac,"I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world"
2pac,"I told you I was comin' back later on, right?
So you don't believe a nigga?"

Wake up sweaty and screamin'"
2pac,"How do you feel?

2pac,"In today's music news: the ever-controversial Tupac Shakur has just released another album under the alias ""Makaveli."" Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artists' street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail inter-chart movement. Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album, resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr. Shakur but of Death Row Records as well. Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac's – excuse me – Makaveli's verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers. JAY-Z from ""Hawaiian Sophie"" fame, Big Little whatever, and several other corny-sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release. The question everybody wants to know is: why'd they get this nigga started? 2Pac – rather Makaveli – was not available for comment but released this statement:
It's not about East or West"
2pac,"Teddy Riley?
Who?"
2pac,"Don't wanna rush ya, but make your mind up fast
Nobody knows, on who controls will it last?"
2pac,"I don't see no devils bleedin', only black blood drippin'
We can change — what your mouth say?"
2pac,"They claim we inferior, so why the fuck these devils fear ya?
I'm watchin' my nation die, genocide the cause"

2pac,"Said he wanna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug"
2pac,"My .44 make sure all y'all kids don't grow

2pac,"But buy a .44, blastin' at playa haters wantin' more

To all my niggas engaged in makin' money in the fifty states"
2pac,"Erotic, psychotic, when possess by bodies

Confidence for you shaky-ass folks"
2pac,"Nobody knows where we'll be
My enemies your enemies"
2pac,"Get my weight up with my hate and pay 'em back when I'm bigger
And still thuggin' in this jail cell, missin' my block"
2pac,"Pissing while practicing how to pimp and be a playa
Overdose of a dick while drinking liquor when I lay her"
2pac,"I'm 'bout to crash up on the curb 'cause my vision's blurry
Maybe if they tried to understand me – what should I do?"
2pac,"Mash shit from here to here, day by day, year to year

We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark"
2pac,"I sexed his sister, had him mumblin'
Like a Mexican"
2pac,"To live and die in L.A. (California)
No matter what you say about Los Angeles"
2pac,"Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show"
2pac,"That's what money and fame do, see, they ain't true
Travelin' this road, my poor soul has been consolidated"
2pac,"Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy"
2pac,"It's visitin' day at San Quentin, always there to see your closest roaddog

I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar"
2pac,"(Step up, step-step up, step up)
'Round and 'round, 'round we go (stronger than ever)"
2pac,"You don't wanna fuck with me (My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me"
2pac,"As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die"
2pac,"All my niggas now, just my niggas come!
Where my niggas at? Just my niggas now!"
2pac,"So step but you better step quick
'Cause the clock's going tick and I'm sick of the bullshit"
2pac,"Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?
It ain't easy bein' me"
2pac,"Payback, I knew you bitch niggas from way back
Witnessed me strapped with MACs, knew I wouldn't play that"
2pac,"Thug for life, nigga
Can't you read the signs?"
2pac,"Let it ride, tonight's the night
Well, I comes through with two packs of the bomb prophylac's"
2pac,"Comin' back after all these years
""Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat,"" that's the way it is"

2pac,"I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles (Own bottles)
I make mistakes, but learn from every one"
2pac,"And your pop stars popped, get mopped and dropped
All your fake-ass East Coast props brainstormed and locked (Haha)"
2pac,"Got a nigga goin' crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy"
2pac,"If the old school didn't pave the way""
""What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today"
2pac,"‘Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know
Passionately yours and I'll never let you go"
2pac,"(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter"
2pac,"All the peoples I met along the way
Better days is comin', homeboy, keep your head up!"
2pac,"Copper say, ""Freeze, or you'll be dead today""
Trapped in a corner, dark and I couldn't see the light"
2pac,"Takin' risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from gettin' on her
Life in the hood is all good for nobody"
2pac,"So I'm droppin' to my knees, ""Oh why!""
Why you had to take my nigga with the rock-a-bye?"
2pac,"Since you lie, die, goodbye!
Let the real live niggas hear the truth from me (Hey)"
2pac,"They act like they never seen a motherfucker wearing black
Following a nigga and shit, ain't this a bitch?"
2pac,"My younger homie's seventeen and he paid a price
Lil' young motherfucker doin' triple life"
2pac,"Only fear of death— (You ghetto niggas)
Only fear of death is comin' back reincarnated"
2pac,"West Coast rider, comin' right behind ya
Should have never fucked with me"

That's real, got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him"
2pac,"This year you motherfuckers gon' be dust
Thug Life, nigga, Westside!"
2pac,"When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)"
2pac,"This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio gettin' blow"
2pac,"Tell me what to say to my unborn seed, in case I pass away
Will my child get to feel love?"
2pac,"Now that we made it, it's a battle just for the big money
I'm livin' wild, no smiles, 'cause ain't a thing funny"
2pac,"You know what time it is, the Outlaw clique
Young, rugged and sick"
2pac,"Now If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us"
2pac,"Where my people at? Show me where my people at!
All my niggas now, just my niggas come!"
2pac,"And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby"
2pac,"Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real"
2pac,"Scream my name ‘cause, baby, it's delicious
Got a weak spot for pretty bitches"
2pac,"She's so scandalous (She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous)
Ayo, how the pretty bitch be, the more scandalous the ho be"
2pac,"I cry because I'm on my own
The tears I cry R bitter and warm"
2pac,"Meanwhile, buy me a drink and get to winkin' at me
She smiles; a nigga's full of passion, satisfaction is everlastin'"
2pac,"'Cause my mama say I'm good for nothin', so I'm out
Since I only got one life to live, God forgive me for my sins"
2pac,"Smokin' Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world?"
2pac,"Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came"
2pac,"Catch 'em while they sleepin'
Now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'"
2pac,"From now until for motherfuckin' ever
Half-nots in this, motherfucker, yeah"

Is y'all ready for me? We up out this bitch"
2pac,"My enemies your enemies
'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me"
2pac,"If it's on, then it's on, we rape beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?"
2pac,"It's hard enough to live now in these times of greed
They say Jesus is a kind man"
2pac,"You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha"
2pac,"I get around, the Underground just don't stop for hoes
Round and round"
2pac,"Picture the scenery 'cause for now you gon' have to imagine
Call me your prophet 'cause I predicted what's gon' happen"
2pac,"Set it off, set it off! Let’s be friends! Where my niggas at?
Where my niggas, where my niggas, where my niggas at?"
2pac,"This song was mixed and released posthumously, one of many songs... Read More
To my unborn child"
2pac,"Plus with the drama, we're lookin' out for your baby's mama
Takin' risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from gettin' on her"
2pac,"Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
""It's time to fight back,"" that's what Huey said"
2pac,"Ooh wee
Can you see me now?"
2pac,"I'm watchin' as the world goes by
'Cause they don't give a fuck about us"
2pac,"A Mac-10 out the window 'bout to let it loose
What could I do? Run for cover and return fire"
2pac,"Lord knows, I tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die"
2pac,"They've got weed, they've got money
They're with a lot of black women, what should we do, Sarge?"
2pac,"(Keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier"
2pac,"Unless y'all choose to
Use your brain, use your brain"
2pac,"Puttin' down, mashin', control by this thug's passion
Unlike them other bustas pistol blastin', I'm askin' what happened"
2pac,"My adversaries get fucked, feel me?
Multimillionaire dreams"
2pac,"One time for my niggas in the jail cells (One time)
One time for my niggas doin' life in Hell"
2pac,"As the deadly virus spread through your head like Sand Palm
There's no escape, nah, I ain't blastin'"
2pac,"We got evicted, had to leave the 'burbs
Back in the ghetto, doin' wild shit"
2pac,"So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life"
2pac,"Niggas know what we gotta do: just gotta put our mind to it and do it, it's all about the papers, money rule the world
Bitches make the world go round"
2pac,"Outlawz, Makaveli The Don
Hussein Fatal, Edi Amin, Kastro"
2pac,"My only fear of death is comin' back reincarnated
This is dedicated to Mental, R.I.P. and Big Kato, R.I.P"
2pac,"Not motherfucking double R, Richie baby
What's happening baby, you know how we do it"
2pac,"We can change — what your mouth say?
I'm watchin' niggas work their lives out without pay"
2pac,"Shit, nobody else would give a fuck
If I'm tore down, from the floor down, six-feet deep in the cut"
2pac,"(Remember what my pops told me)
Using the name of the Lord in vain"
2pac,"I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?"
2pac,"There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'"
2pac,"Said he's gonna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug"
2pac,"Body talkin' shit to me, but I can't comprehend the meanin'
Now, if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance"
2pac,"The world ain't ready for us yet so let's make Clinton pay
They never wanted us to make it"
2pac,"Aww, yeah-yeah (Hear me)

Well, we are the roses - this is the concrete - and these are"
2pac,"it learned 2 breathe fresh air
Long live the rose that grew from concrete"
2pac,"My lyrical verge with so much pain, to some niggas, it hurts
My guns bust, if you ain't one of us, it gets worse"
2pac,"We ain't meant to survive 'cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up"
2pac,"You tell me my world is in peace, but nigga, you're lyin'
'Cause half of my niggas long gone"
2pac,"Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this mad underground basement shit I'm laced with"
2pac,"I got homies that will hunt you 'til you drop
I hope the Lord can forgive me"
2pac,"While I'm tuggin' on your main bitch head
Understand this: ain't no nigga like me, fuck Jay-Z!"
2pac,"Yo, this how we gonna do this in the nine-trey, y'know?
Throw your fingers up"
2pac,"I can see you wanna stray, there's a way out
Keep your mind on your money, enroll in school"

You headin' to his car for some sex?"
2pac,"Gone on, 'cause they passed away
Niggas doin' life"
2pac,"Thug passion got you tremblin' like Death on the Row (Yeah)
Make your move, so I can throw your mind a curve"
2pac,"Went in her purse took a hundred dollars
Nigga, I'm so scandalous"
2pac,"My strategy's official, checkin' ya pockets while I tongue kiss you
Soft as tissue, so my next issue is how to diss you"
2pac,"Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it? (Yeah-yeah)"
2pac,"They say pussy and paper is poetry, power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you"
2pac,"What you won't do, do for love? (Oh, yeah, sucker for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (Oh, baby)"
2pac,"Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
Raised as a youth, tell the truth"
2pac,"Secrets in the dark only her and I know
Now I'm sittin' in the state pen', doin' time slow"
2pac,"Full of drama like a soap opera
On the curb watchin' the ghetto bird helicopters"
2pac,"I can't cope, me and the homies smokin' roaches
'Cause we broke, late night, hangin' out 'til the sunrise"
2pac,"Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em"
2pac,"Where my niggas at? Show me where my niggas at?
Where my bitches at? Thug style!"
2pac,"One love from a thug nigga
Rollin' with a posse full of paranoid drug dealers"
2pac,"Let's show these fools how we do it over on this Westside
'Cause you and I know it's the best side"
2pac,"I gotta puff a gang of weed to keep from goin' under
The federales wanna see me dead"
2pac,"Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots (Oh)"
2pac,"It was hard to keep my dick in my pants, every time you pass
Got me checkin' for you hardcore, starin' and watchin'"
2pac,"Vivid pictures of my enemies, family times
God forgive me ‘cause it's wrong, but I plan to die"
2pac,"Know what it means to be black, whether a man or girl
We still strugglin' in this white man's world"
2pac,"I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last"
2pac,"Your body's hypnotizing, your smell is so exciting
So baby come on home with me"
2pac,"Come put your mouth on this pistol, nigga
Come put your mouth on the pistol, no more pain"
2pac,"While you proceed with precision, you had the table hosed
No, I ain't mad at you, baby, go 'head and play them fools"
2pac,"But they wrong, so I'm solo and so broke
Savin' up for some Jordan's, ‘cause they dope"
2pac,"Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller, but you still rolled"
2pac,"Young Noble, Outlaw 'til these motherfuckers kill me
I'm still breathin'"
2pac,"Ran out of indo, and my mind can't take the stress, I'm out of breath
Make me wanna kill my damn self, but I see death around the corner"
2pac,"(To live and die in L.A., mhmmm)
L.A"
2pac,"Won't be no bullshit, no ass-kissin'
This bitch'll have ya wakin' up with all your cash missin'"
2pac,"This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio gettin' blow"
2pac,"That they gotta tell me how to live my life
You know?"
2pac,"Dead away where there's war play
Fuck friends! I'll say, rather die for my A-K"
2pac,"Would you be wrong for buckin' a nigga to the pavement?
He gon' get me first, if I don't get him, fool, start prayin'"
2pac,"At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary"
2pac,"Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down"
2pac,"Don't settle for less, even the genius asks his questions
Be grateful for blessings, don't ever change, keep your essence"
2pac,"How do you want it? (Yeah-yeah)
How does it feel? (Ooh, Yeah)"
2pac,"Since they don't give a fuck, I don't; feel what I'm sayin'?
Now, thug niggas die but multiply in doubles"
2pac,"And fade fools, break rules until we major
Blaze up, getting with hoes through my pager"
2pac,"Soon as I opened up the door with your jealous questions
Like, where can I be? You're killin' me with your jealousy"
2pac,"Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real"
2pac,"Feel this, Killuminati
Lord have mercy, Father help us all"
2pac,"I got the scoop on how to get a bulletproof
Lickin' shots off from the roof"
2pac,"Trapped
Uh-uh, they can't keep the Black man down"
2pac,"Tryna creep through these halls and brawls without scarred by a revolve'
With no warning signs, ‘cause yo, my man took five"
2pac,"Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be"
2pac,"Hold me no more, hold me no more
Yes it do, yes it do, yes it do"
2pac,"Don't let the Westside ride tonight (Haha)
Bad Boy murdered on wax and killed"
2pac,"Bust – on motherfuckers with a passion
Better duck, ‘cause I ain't lookin' when I'm b-blastin'"
2pac,"Pray to the Heaven's, .357's to the sky
And I hope I'm forgiven for thug livin' when I die"
2pac,"Until you get through, I'll be waitin'
Yo 'Pac, you know I'm 16 strong behind you boo"
2pac,"Let my angels sing
You've got to be there to know it"
2pac,"Against all odds
Hopin' my true motherfuckers know"
2pac,"He shot first and I'll be damned if I run away
Homie is done away, I should've put my gun away"
2pac,"Never fear, never worry
If I die tonight"
2pac,"When I got you on canine fours
Prayin' to God as your life goes back and forth"
2pac,"I learned not to trust a bitch from the prostitutes
Was taught lessons, a young nigga askin' questions"
2pac,"Two in the morning and we still high, assed out
Screamin', ""Thug 'til I die!"" before I passed out"
2pac,"Shed tears as we bury niggas close to heart
What was a friend, now a ghost in the dark"
2pac,"That there's a million motherfuckers stressin' just like me
Only God can judge me"
2pac,"Watch Mama open up her arms to hug me
And I ain't worried 'bout a damn thing, with unconditional love"
2pac,"Guess you figure you know me, 'cause I'm a thug
That love to hit the late night clubs, drink them Buds"
2pac,"From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your thug passion, baby, ohh"
2pac,"I put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit
Keep your head up, nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer"
2pac,"If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
They don't give a fuck about us"
2pac,"The world moves fast and it would rather pass u by

2pac,"Smokin' too much weed, got me paranoid, stressed
Pack a gat and a vest under my clothes when I dress"
2pac,"How do you feel? (Ohh-ohh)
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game"
2pac,"Man, I stay on point like icicles
Now, who wanna test Tical, then tes-ticles"
2pac,"Lord, I suffered through the years and shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers and shed so many tears"
2pac,"That's what they should say, y'knowhatImean?
All the trouble to survive and make good out of the dirty, nasty"
2pac,"Got to be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when you see me, nigga, you better holla at me"
2pac,"You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player"
2pac,"I could hardly wait to bust freely
Got you red-hot, you so happy to see me"
2pac,"I-N-S the Rebel
Wist, bliss, this"
2pac,"And we turnin' bad boys to grown men, it's on again

2pac,"Let you get my last shot of Hennessy, ain't never had a friend like me
Remember memories so vividly"
2pac,"Throw up the block 'cause nothin' stops my chips
A boss playa with this, that twist you lame tricks"
2pac,"It's like your man don't understand, all he does is stress ya
I can see your state of misery from the introduction"
2pac,"Bustin' my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin'"
2pac,"Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me"
2pac,"Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark"
2pac,"Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'
Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player"
2pac,"You can't see me
Right between your eyes and you'll never realize"
2pac,"Me against the world
'Cause it's just me against the world, baby (Hey)"

Drake,"Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence"
Drake,"Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed"
Drake,"That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally"

There's things we might discover"
Drake,"All good, Chubbs will look around
Find one that seem my type"
Drake,"I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane

You're reckless and you know it, they don't love you like I do"
Drake,"And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it
Girl, don't treat me like a stranger, girl, you know I seen you naked"
Drake,"How 'bout now? Yeah
Girl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now, girl?"
Drake,"There's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved

Drake,"But we all so spoiled now
More life, more everything"
Drake,"I got a new boy, and that nigga trade
Kiki, do you love me? Are you riding?"

Drake,"Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd cry for me"

Niggas can't even win home games, they just gotta fall in line like Soul Train"
Drake,"Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it"
Drake,"Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring

Drake,"I just want some head in a comfortable bed
It could all be so simple"

If I don't—"
Drake,"No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit goes"
Drake,"Proposed in 2015, but don't wanna make her your actual wife
I'm guessin' this wedding ain't happenin', right?"
Drake,"But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance"
Drake,"That new shit that you got is overdue

Drake,"(Yeah)
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to"
Drake,"Yeah, back and forth across the borderline
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime"
Drake,"(The things you do)
(Rock me real slowly)"
Drake,"I've been me since Scarlett Road, ayy (Road, ayy)
Might go down as G-O-D (Yeah, wait, yeah)"
Drake,"This has been years in the makin'
It's all for the city, they know I come right every summer"
Drake,"And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue"
Drake,"Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'"
Drake,"I've had sex four times this week, I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame"
Drake,"The ones you never bring around me
'Cause you don't trust me like your last man"
Drake,"I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me"
Drake,"You just actin' like an activist, it's make-believe
Don't even go back to your hood and plant no money trees"
Drake,"Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops"
Drake,"Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life"
Drake,"Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
See, I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last, Tunechi"
Drake,"Other than the family I got, it's either you or me
That's just how I think, it's either you or me"
Drake,"Oh my God, oh my God, if I die, I'm a legend
I'm the one, one"
Drake,"Looking like you came from the seventies on your own
My mother is sixty-six and her favorite line to hit me with is"
Drake,"Yeah, I'm good, you still working?
Tonight, right now?"
Drake,"You bitches really get carried away
Makin' mistakes, then you beg me to stay"
Drake,"Own it, baby, own it, it's yours
Own that shit, own that shit, own that shit"
Drake,"Yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl"
Drake,"This shit gotta be over by now for anyone out here that's calling it, right?
You're dead"
Drake,"Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out"
Drake,"And I'm down for you always
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, he bad"
Drake,"You gotta learn to fact-check things and be less impatient
Your fans are rejoicin' thinkin' this is my expiration"
Drake,"You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah"
Drake,"And I’m never on a waste ting shawty
I do it how you say you want it"
Drake,"I don't wanna fight with a woman beater, it feeds your nature
If you still bumpin' R. Kelly, you could thank the Savior"
Drake,"You know me? You know me?
I'm liable to do anything when it comes to that you owe me"
Drake,"Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
Uh, so much for being optimistic"
Drake,"Tell Obama that my verses are just like the whips that he in
They bulletproof"
Drake,"I told 'em, ""Less is more, nigga, it's plenty of us""
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik"
Drake,"Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em"
Drake,"You know what it is whenever I visit
Windy city, she blowin' me kisses, no"
Drake,"I'm in love, I'm in love with two girls at one time
And they tens, that's why I got ten on my mind"
Drake,"And I thank you, I don't know where I'd really be without that
It worked out, man, you deserve it"
Drake,"Anything to take the spotlight off the fact the boss is a drugged-out lil' punk sissy from the Northside
Rakim talkin' shit again"
Drake,"I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?
Now she want a photo, you already know, though"
Drake,"I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing"
Drake,"I think I'd lie for you
I think I'd die for you"
Drake,"Just make sure they that special somebody
Young Money, yeah, yeah"
Drake,"And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright"
Drake,"You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston"
Drake,"You know it, oh, you know it
Oh, you know it, we both know it"
Drake,"Uh, I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot, but my jet don't lag"
Drake,"And I be hearin' the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time, yeah"
Drake,"'Cause we—
Started from the bottom, now we're here"
Drake,"Well, not that kind of free, I'm talkin' 'bout my nigga Dave
Your man a lil' K, we call that shit a mini Drac'"
Drake,"Just to have this talk with your ass, I had to hike down
Big difference 'tween Mike then and Mike now"
Drake,"She don't even love me, she just puttin' on a front (Front)
She gon' try and settle outta court and make a run"
Drake,"'Cause we never decided, tell me how you feel inside
You a real ass woman and I like it, yeah"
Drake,"Sold a couple Bentley last week
Them were my old toys (Man, this shit is old)"
Drake,"He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency"
Drake,"It's yours
It's yours"
Drake,"Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself"
Drake,"Trust, we heard you the first time
It’s nothing personal I would have done it to anyone"
Drake,"Nobody really likes us except for us
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up"
Drake,"You actin' kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?"
Drake,"Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to somethin'
They just spent like two or three weeks out the country"
Drake,"Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home"
Drake,"She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top"
Drake,"Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time"
Drake,"It's a OVO ting, eh?
Ya dun know, eh?"
Drake,"Before I was ever around Kendall's, I was at ends though, dreamin' up Enzos
The woman I do end up with has to be a bad gyal just like Munchie"
Drake,"You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong"
Drake,"I grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it
I'm not a GOAT, but I fit the description"
Drake,"Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days
'Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days (Trippin')"
Drake,"Yeah
It's a Habibis ting, ya?"
Drake,"But I guess that's how you niggas gettin' down
I'm so high up I'm like, ""How is niggas really gettin' down?"""
Drake,"Niggas moves so waste
Please come outside the house and show yourself"
Drake,"Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright
Oh, I know you don't love me, baby"
Drake,"Metro, shut your ho ass up and make some drums, nigga
Yeah, I'm the 6ix God, I'm the frontrunner"
Drake,"This about to get so depressin'
This is trauma from your own confessions"
Drake,"Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now"
Drake,"Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do"
Drake,"I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover"
Drake,"You niggas leeches and serpents
I think it's good that now the teachers are learnin', yeah"
Drake,"Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep"
Drake,"Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy"
Drake,"I am a war general sеasoned in preparation
My jacket is covеred in medals, honor and decoration"
Drake,"You like to slide on a late night
You sent a ""Are you here?"" text without an invite"
Drake,"Can't get no more free, Randy
Got everything, I got everything"
Drake,"And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with, 'cause"
Drake,"Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year"
Drake,"(Machine gun rap for all my niggas in the back) Uh
(Machine gun rap for all my niggas in the back) Uh"
Drake,"Your lack of effort got me rappin' different
This the shit I wanna go out to"
Drake,"Oh, you at the club cashin' out with Eric, damn, hit me when you done your shift
I know a girl I should propose to, but we just on some different shit"
Drake,"This a ""forever"" thing
Hate that I treat it like it's a ""whatever"" thing"
Drake,"Yeah, isn't it amazing
How you talk all this shit and we still lack communication?"
Drake,"Looking, looking
Looking"
Drake,"My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'"
Drake,"Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade"
Drake,"Mo-G with the dance moves
Ave Boy with the dance moves"
Drake,"And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose"
Drake,"Yeah
Let me stop playin' around, let me take this shit serious, like"
Drake,"Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do"
Drake,"Hoe, shut the fuck up

Then I came, right back on my worst behav'"
Drake,"You need that work? I got that work, got bitches in my condo ('Do)
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note (Tell 'em)"
Drake,"Probably gotta have a kid again 'fore you think of droppin' any shit again
Even when you do drop, they gon' say you should've modeled 'cause it's mid again"
Drake,"Like controlla, controlla, yeah
Gyal a tear off mi garments"
Drake,"And still gotta pull out
But that's just me, and I ain't perfect"
Drake,"I switch flow like I switch time zone
Can't get Nobu, but you can get Milestone (Baka)"
Drake,"Say a different number than the one that's in my head
Lying to protect you, I be doing that a lot"
Drake,"It can't end like this
We gotta take time with this"
Drake,"And since you pick up, I know he's not around, oh, oh
Are you drunk right now?"
Drake,"That's the shit I'm talking 'bout though, like you changed up, you don't even fuckin' link nobody no more, you just dash me away like a cyattie. Yo, you cheesed me dog
Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture"
Drake,"And you've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes"
Drake,"They tryna take the wave from a nigga
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga (6ix)"
Drake,"Aw, yeah, aw, yeah
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah"
Drake,"And the weekend's here, started it right
Even if you only get part of it right"
Drake,"I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it"
Drake,"Young rebel, Young Money, nothin' you could tell me
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me"
Drake,"Yeah, bullets that I'm stuffin' in each chamber, your ass in extreme danger
Stop buyin' views and bot comments, you may as well keep the paper"
Drake,"I can't change, this shit set in stone
They can't live this long"
Drake,"Can't let this one slide, ayy
Don't you wanna dance with me? No?"
Drake,"Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
Whole squad on that real shit"
Drake,"Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough, I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'"
Drake,"Should drive by right where you live and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, prolly put me in the past"
Drake,"Where I was rapping with Jas over beats that I shouldn't have
In the hopes for the glory"
Drake,"Burrrrat stick it, ba-ba-ba stick it
Burrrrat stick it, ba-ba-ba stick it"

Famous as fuck but I’m still in the cut when they round up the troops"
Drake,"How beautiful our kids would be, girl, I don't need convincing
How every conversation starts with, ""This time will be different"""
Drake,"Takin' shots, feelin' bulletproof
Flood my Rollie, told my bitch: ""Let's go snorkelin'!"" (Yeah)"
Drake,"Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision"
Drake,"I really shouldn't have given you none of my time
'Cause you older than the nigga you runnin' behind"
Drake,"All I really know is W's and M's, life lookin' like a bathroom
All I really know is M bags like I drove through and ordered fast food"
Drake,"You know how that shit go

Drake,"That's the wrong thing to do
'Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying"
Drake,"You tell these hoes you ain't cuddlin'
But with me, you know you doin' all that shit"
Drake,"I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more"
Drake,"Got a Hennessy in my hand

Nigga, just as a reminder to myself"
Drake,"Who's smart from who's the fool
Which utensil to use for which food, like"
Drake,"You won't ever take no chain off of us
How the fuck you big steppin' with a size-seven men's on?"

Drake,"Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
They want me gone, out of the picture (Yah)"
Drake,"I could never have a kid, then be out here still kiddin' round

Drake,"I still love it but I used to love it more
FaceTime with my shawty on tour"
Drake,"I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing"
Drake,"Word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year"
Drake,"Don't know why I listen to you when I hear you talkin' to me, it's some half-truths
If I don't pay your rent, it end up like an old hairstyle, girl, it's past due"
Drake,"How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
Niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga"
Drake,"I could show you bigger things than that
It's gon' be a minute 'til I'm back"
Drake,"We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown-ups"
Drake,"(It's always gonna be yours)

Drake,"Owl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist"

Then right after, texted and told her I'm faded"
Drake,"Area code in my phone

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much"
Drake,"I can tell that love is fake (I can tell that love is fake)

Why second guess? I should have stayed"
Drake,"Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

Drake,"Guess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas
For real, some nobody started feelin' himself"
Drake,"I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing"
Drake,"Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes

Wanna come places with star girls"
Drake,"Niko never move neeky, sweatsuit Nike, sweatsuit DG
If man get beaky, ring ring, call up GiGi, do him up neatly"
Drake,"Feds in the city hate to see us on a high note (Woo)
I switch flow like I switch time zone"
Drake,"Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things"
Drake,"How 'bout now? Yeah
Girl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now, girl?"
Drake,"High school pics, you was even bad then
You ain't stressin' off no lover in the past tense"
Drake,"But that's just me, and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint, but I am worth it"
Drake,"Oh, you pullin' shit together, I can tell, baby (Oh-oh)
Is you single or what? I need a girl from the country"
Drake,"So let's just get it out the way
Lot of niggas goin' bad on me"
Drake,"Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need a hit"
Drake,"That's a real one in your reflection
Without a follow, without a mention"
Drake,"Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no"

Party tonight, party tonight"
Drake,"Used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes

Drake,"It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours
That's for sure, that's for sure"
Drake,"We know why you mad, nigga, I ain't even trippin'
All that lil' heartbroken Twitter shit for bitches"
Drake,"Mmm-mmm, fuck it, I was wrong, though
Shout out to all my niggas livin' tax-free"
Drake,"Jas just lined up brand new hand tings and nice guy on a madting
Everyone I know has codenames, anyone I'm beefin' with is a no-name"
Drake,"And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change"
Drake,"Uh, I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all-black Maybach, but I'm not a racist"
Drake,"I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sittin' talkin' 'bout bitches that we almost had"
Drake,"That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place"
Drake,"And the boy that sound like he sang on Thriller, you know that's been my nigga
Yeah, we just had to fix things, family, 6ix tings, we can't split up"
Drake,"Those are strings that you can’t pull
Yeah, and I could really dish it out"
Drake,"Now you're talkin' my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you"
Drake,"And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?"
Drake,"I'm still a canine at heart, I'm a dog
Yeah, that's why you gotta come through quick, quick"
Drake,"Yeah

Drake,"And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by its cover
I don't wan' be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder"
Drake,"Yeah, who gassed you to play with me?
Man, you made this shit as easy as ABCs"
Drake,"Then gon' ask me how I'm doin'?
I'm upset ('Set, 'set)"
Drake,"Who you been crying to? Who you been flying to?
Whose bed are you sleeping in? Someone's been hiding you"
Drake,"Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say"
Drake,"Must I remind you that Jimmy got 20 million on it?
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it"
Drake,"It's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe
Niggas treat me like I've been here for 10"
Drake,"I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you, yeah"
Drake,"You might feel like nothin' was the same
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low"
Drake,"Here's the pitch
It's belted deep to center"
Drake,"Will I see you at the show tonight?
Ayy, truck to the plane to the truck"
Drake,"How the fuck you big steppin' with a size-seven men's on?
This the bark with the bite, nigga, what's up?"
Drake,"The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me"
Drake,"Probably wouldn't lose a single rapper
Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter"
Drake,"Drake details his anxiety about reaching his goal of being the best rapper in... Read More

Prince, I carry that last name, that shit stays on me like brand names"
Drake,"Two hundred shooters on my brother's block, woah, yeah
Petal off a rose like I love her not, maybe not"
Drake,"Yeah, looking back on it, at least my pride is intact
'Cause we said ""no strings attached"" and I still got tied up in that"
Drake,"Money comin' fast, we never gettin' sleep
I, I just had to buy another safe"
Drake,"Cups of the rosé
Bitches in my old phone"
Drake,"You should call

Drake,"And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight"

Touch down, gotta see what's up"
Drake,"Buckles on the jacket, it's Alyx shit
Nike crossbody, got a piece in it"
Drake,"So I'ma fall back and let SZA talk her shit for a minute
Slimin' you out, slimin' you out, slime"
Drake,"I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?"
Drake,"A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us"
Drake,"And this ain't no time for uncertainty
And this ain't no time for locking your phone and not coming home"
Drake,"Told me everything about you, that's a bold move
I know that you're out here"
Drake,"Pasha Sasha pissed, I was way too young at the time for slashings
You niggas spend too much time on captions, not enough time on action"
Drake,"I got high hopes for you niggas, we gon' see
I got money in the courts 'til all my niggas are free"
Drake,"Did he open doors for ya?
Buy the things you can't afford for ya?"
Drake,"And don't assume, 'cause I don't respect assumptions, babe
I'm just tryna connect with somethin', babe"

I can tell that love is fake (I can tell that love is fake)"
Drake,"I'ma always take the money over sex
That's why they need me out the way, what you expect?"
Drake,"Y'all keep playin' with your nose, yeah
You get high and do the most, yeah"
Drake,"I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it"
Drake,"I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence"
Drake,"I didn't listen to Hov on that old song
When he told me, ""Pay it no mind"""
Drake,"And that just didn't sit right with you, yeah
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose"
Drake,"Got my Spanish ting convinced that I know Spanish
Really, when she get to talkin', I don't understand it"
Drake,"AXL (AXL), AXL (AXL), AXL (AXL)

But we look up to them, they wish they were us"
Drake,"6'1"", man, a nigga need some leg room

And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops"
Drake,"Should repent, I need me some Jesus in my life

I got one girl, and she my girl, and nobody else can hit it (Try a ting)"
Drake,"You only live once, that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we 'bout it every day, every day, every day"
Drake,"Let's just not even discuss it, man

Drake,"I need a girl who gon' love me
I need a girl who gon' trust me, someone to fuck me"
Drake,"No pun intended, but they smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?"
Drake,"Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like"
Drake,"Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don't play"
Drake,"Really, I just can't afford to lose nobody else, yeah

Drake,"After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week, I'll explain"
Drake,"Bigger the business, the bigger the office
I fucked 'round and found me a swag, then I caught up"
Drake,"It's clearly because of The Boy, the honorable thing is to give me the loot
You right about ""Fuck the big three,"" it's only Big D, and there's video proof"
Drake,"You don’t have to try and say it louder, nigga
Trust, we heard you the first time"
Drake,"Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness"
Drake,"But soon as I started confessin' my sins, he wouldn't believe us
Sins, I got sins on my mind"
Drake,"All you boys in the new Toronto want to be me a little
All your exes know I like my O’s with a V in the middle"

Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before"
Drake,"Yeah, I’m light-skinned, but I'm still a dark nigga
I'm a wig splitta, I'm a tall figure"
Drake,"And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice"
Drake,"Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me"
Drake,"I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found"
Drake,"Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time"
Drake,"That's why every song sound like Drake featurin' Drake
Str8, Y pree? Why is it always me?"
Drake,"This is trauma from your own confessions
This when your father leave you home alone with no protection, so neglected"
Drake,"I gotta get money, I love to get charter
I gave her four Birkins and one's for her daughter (Skrrt)"
Drake,"'Cause I want ya, and I need ya

Drake,"And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright"
Drake,"These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else"
Drake,"I never really had no one like you, man, this all new shit

Drake,"I'm still awake, I gotta shine this year
I could never ever let the streets down"
Drake,"I can't even listen, you wildin'
I'd much rather sit here in silence"
Drake,"Yeah, I might just go get the fade, buy the du-rag and just tie the waves
Yeah, it's lit at the crib, you could stay, me and Drake kick like Kid N' Play (Kid N' Play)"

Enough to make you throw up, man, it's gross what I net"
Drake,"Is you wit' me or what?

Drake,"Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently
Yeah"
Drake,"I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace

Drake,"Maybe I should walk up the street
And try and get a job at the bank"
Drake,"That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand"
Drake,"I learned workin' with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture"
Drake,"I'm an unforgivin' wild-ass dog nigga
Somethin' wrong with 'em, got 'em all bitter"
Drake,"I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believed in everything but me, girl, I don't get you"
Drake,"Without 40, Oli, there'd be no me
'Magine if I never met the broskies"
Drake,"Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul (For my soul)"
Drake,"You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored"
Drake,"I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me"
Drake,"Extortion baby, whole career, you been shook up
'Cause Top told you, ""Drop and give me fifty,"" like some push-ups, huh"
Drake,"And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure, damn"
Drake,"We go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bills shit"
Drake,"I know my picture on the wall when y'all cook up
Extortion baby, whole career, you been shook up"
Drake,"Comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights"
Drake,"But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?"

But when it falls apart, I'm always still down"
Drake,"Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?
Real nigga, what's up?"
Drake,"These days I'm lettin' God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reason you love me"
Drake,"September, we fallin' off, but I'm still the man you tryna win over
October is all about me 'cause your turn should've been over"
Drake,"All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah"

Drake,"Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal"
Drake,"Michael Phelps with the swim moves

We must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind"
Drake,"You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me
Baby, it's yours, nobody else's"
Drake,"Turn it all up
Yeah, look"
Drake,"What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same"
Drake,"Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot"
Drake,"But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems askin' what was said and who was involved"
Drake,"Soundin' like you send him commissary when he need some paper
Album droppin' soon, no wonder you turn to a clout chaser 'stead of doin' hard labor"
Drake,"Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew"
Drake,"Girl, you can't always have your way

Just to tell me they ain't really friends"
Drake,"It's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that"

I thought you were the one from the jump, that confirmed it"
Drake,"All the energy that you bring to me
My last girl would tear me apart"
Drake,"Worst behavior
Mothafuckers never loved us"
Drake,"I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try"
Drake,"But I'll send a hit while I chill with my children
Bigger the business, the bigger the office"
Drake,"I dedicate, I dedicate

She'll even tell you leave the boy alone 'fore you get your head split again"
Drake,"But I do know one thing though
Women, they come they go"
Drake,"When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it"
Drake,"Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things"

Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions"
Drake,"Oti, oti

Came up, that's all me"
Drake,"Like controlla, controlla, yeah
Like controlla, controlla, yeah"
Drake,"You actin' kinda shady, baby

I think that pretty much resembles what's been happenin' lately"
Drake,"'Cause you're a good girl and you know it (Oh yeah)
You act so different around me (Ah-ah, da-da)"

Drake,"And why isn't Whitney denyin' all of the allegations?
Why is she followin' Dave Free and not Mr. Morale?"
Drake,"We both a different breed
I'm followin' your lead, I ask you what you need"
Drake,"There's things we might discover
'Cause you got a past and I do too"
Drake,"That's why all your friends dippin' to Atlanta, payin' just to find a tour guide
Abel, run your fuckin' bread, need to buy some more chains for some more guys"
Drake,"Please believe your demise will be televised, yeah
And as for Q, man, I changed his life a couple times"
Drake,"But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?"
Drake,"I said, ""Baby girl, fall in line""
Okay, made a million off a dinner fork"
Drake,"Weeknd music gettin' played in all the spots where boys got a little more pride
That's why all your friends dippin' to Atlanta, payin' just to find a tour guide"
Drake,"Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?"
Drake,"I see you niggas havin' trouble goin' gold
Turnin' into some so-and-sos that no one knows"
Drake,"That's why you're always working out
Taking pictures of yourself"
Drake,"They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body"
Drake,"Oh, just hold on, we're going home (Going home)
Just hold on, we're going home (Going home)"
Drake,"Say my name, say my name

Drake,"The things you do
These days I'm lettin' God handle all things above me"
Drake,"This life got too deep for you, baby
Two or three of us about to creep where they stayin'"
Drake,"When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience"
Drake,"KB, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me"
Drake,"Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a handful of girls and they all so foreign"
Drake,"Black leather glove, no sequins
Buckles on the jacket, it's Alyx shit"
Drake,"Left foot up, right foot, slide
Basically, I'm sayin' either way, we 'bout to slide, ayy"
Drake,"See, this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
Just make sure they that special somebody"
Drake,"Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization"
Drake,"But we look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim, we lust for some trust"
Drake,"Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimmin', that's just how I'm livin'"
Drake,"We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road"
Drake,"That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling"
Drake,"Rolling Loud stage, y'all were turnt, that was slick as hell
Shit'll probably change if your BM start to kiss and tell"
Drake,"We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time"
Drake,"All me for real
Came up, that's all me"
Drake,"But we sure make it feel like we're together
'Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else"
Drake,"And I ain't even plannin' to call

Drake,"You done done it all
I swear to God, niggas talk more than bitches these days"
Drake,"Throughout the track, Drake discusses alimony and how he... Read More

Drake,"Oh my God, oh my God, if I die, I'm a legend
Oh my God, oh my God, if I die, I'm a legend"
Drake,"“Oh it’s your time now” yeah, that’s what everybody say
I used to wanna be on Roc-A-Fella then I turned into Jay"
Drake,"I still got like seven years of doin' what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991 (One, one, one)"
Drake,"You act so different around me
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it"
Drake,"Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me"
Drake,"One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me"
Drake,"You act so different around me (Ah-ah, da-da)
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it (Ah-ah-ah)"
Drake,"Fuck what they got goin' on, I gotta represent (Ayy)
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'"
Drake,"I might get a key to the city and give it to Wayne
Or give it to one of the young boys to carry the wave"
Drake,"And they don't like that, it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean"
Drake,"Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?"
Drake,"Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden"
Drake,"I was birthed there in my first year
Man, I know that place like I come from it"
Drake,"For the fantasy of gettin' married, very scary
March got you already second guessin' titles"
Drake,"Say my name
Say my name"
Drake,"And I seen a lot of you die
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy"
Drake,"My accountant say you sinkin' like the Titanic
David Blaine last summer, man, you had to vanish"
Drake,"We get it, we got it
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice"
Drake,"Got a lot of people tryna drain me of my energy
They tryna take the wave from a nigga"
Drake,"I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted"
Drake,"Turn the O2 into the O3, dog
Without 40, Oli, there'd be no me"
Drake,"Gave you everything I loved (Oh)
I think there's something, baby"
Drake,"No help, that's all me
All me for (I) real"
Drake,"And started undressin' and asked me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month"
Drake,"And now he's actin' like, ""Oh, well, this is life, I guess""
Nah, fuck that shit"
Drake,"Yeah, they don't really be the same offline
You know dark days, you know hard times"
Drake,"Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV"
Drake,"We gon' make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes
I get a ring and I bring it home like I’m Cory Joe"
Drake,"Right, my yiy just changed
You just buzzed the front gate"
Drake,"I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live and pick you up on the way"
Drake,"Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flight's in the morning"
Drake,"But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all"
Drake,"Go own that shit, own that shit
Own that shit, own that shit"
Drake,"I mean, we could really get it, we could go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga"
Drake,"Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me, going back to back"
Drake,"Oh, the idea is fun
Oh, the idea is so fun every time"
Drake,"Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'"
Drake,"Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do"
Drake,"Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along"
Drake,"Home
I got my eyes on you"
Drake,"I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it (Arf!)"
Drake,"I thank God you came
How many more days could I wait?"
Drake,"Had a moment but it came and went
(They don't love you no more)"
Drake,"Like controlla, controlla, yeah
Like controlla, controlla, yeah"
Drake,"I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me"
Drake,"Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, so"
Drake,"You won't never get to run me
Just when shit look out of reach"
Drake,"'Cause if I'm goin' anywhere, it's probably too far
Just performed at a bar mitzvah over in the States"
Drake,"She'll even tell you leave the boy alone 'fore you get your head split again
Pluto shit make me sick to my stomach, we ain't never really been through it"
Drake,"I run this shit, they like, ""Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"""
Drake,"Out here beggin' for attention, nigga, say please
Always rappin' like you 'bout to get the slaves freed"
Drake,"You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)

But my actin' days are over, fuck them niggas for life, yeah"
Drake,"15 Fort York shit, y'know?

Drake,"All repping one thing
Looking for revenge"
Drake,"Yeah

Drake,"And you gon' feel the aftermath of what I write down
I'm at the top of the mountain, so you tight now"
Drake,"Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M
Get the-get the-get the-get the-get the"
Drake,"Go slower, go faster
Like controlla, controlla, yeah"
Drake,"She was tryna join the team, I told her wait
Chicken wings and fries, we don't go on dates"
Drake,"Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing"
Drake,"Nah, fuck that shit
Listen, man, you can still do what you wanna do"
Drake,"There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do"
Drake,"Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace"
Drake,"Right before Wayne came and got me out of the back room
Where I was rapping with Jas over beats that I shouldn't have"
Drake,"Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga
He was once a thug—"
Drake,"Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement"
Drake,"You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments
Okay, the flow start to feel familiar, don’t it?"
Drake,"(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion"
Drake,"This the flow that got the block hot, shit got super hot, ayy
Give me my respect (Give me my respect)"
Drake,"Girl, don't treat me like a stranger, girl, you know I seen you naked
Girl, you know that I remember, don't be a pretender"
Drake,"Saturday nights, up in my bed right now
Call up your girl to put them heels on, it's gettin' rowdy, rowdy right now, yeah"
Drake,"I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same"
Drake,"She rode it like a Melpomene soldier
Burrrrat stick it, b-burrrrat stick it"
Drake,"I let the diss record drop, you was staying right below me, nigga
We must have played it a hundred times, you was going to bed"
Drake,"The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me
So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety"
Drake,"They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bills shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit"
Drake,"Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew"
Drake,"Niggas that I knew from when I started in this shit
They see what I got and, man, it's hard to be content"
Drake,"I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with"
Drake,"I got some shit for you to come and get
I'm at the St. Regis up on Briar Oaks, hit me when you done your shift"
Drake,"The things you do
She said, ""You're my everything"""
Drake,"Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love"
Drake,"I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars"
Drake,"One of the album’s many... Read More
What's up?"
Drake,"Your back is up against the curb, you diggin' for dirt, should be diggin' for proof
Why did you move to New York? Is it 'cause you livin' that bachelor life?"
Drake,"And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top"""
Drake,"The song features vocals from Jhene Aiko, production from 40, and piano harmonies from Chilly Gonzales.
One of the album’s many... Read More"
Drake,"Ooh (Yeah)

Drake,"Made some mistakes, pon road

Drake,"Always knew I had to smoke y'all niggas

Drake,"I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you do"
Drake,"Why you gotta fight with me at Cheesecake?
You know I love to go there"
Drake,"That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it"
Drake,"0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga"
Drake,"There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, woah"
Drake,"Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino"
Drake,"First I made you who you are and then I made it
And you're wasted with your latest"
Drake,"It's a East Side ting, eh?
Ya dun know, eh?"
Drake,"And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that"
Drake,"I know you special, girl, 'cause I know too many
'Resha, do you love me? Are you riding?"
Drake,"This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at"
Drake,"But when it falls apart, I'm always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground"
Drake,"Look, look
I don't know why they been lyin', but your shit is not that inspirin'"
Drake,"When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?"
Drake,"Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need"
Drake,"I don't have no time for no misunderstandings again
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'"
Drake,"Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Who could get the pussy quicker these days?"
Drake,"Y'all don't wanna hear me say it's a go
Y'all don't wanna see Win Win, 50 or Whoa"
Drake,"Michael Jordan with the tennis shoes
Skrrt-skrrt, oh"
Drake,"Motherfuckers never loved us
Fucker never loved us"
Drake,"Yeah, I'm on a Mo City trip, I'm on a Mo City trip right now
Ayy, ayy, a Mo City trip right now"

Master manipulator, you bit on the speculation"
Drake,"Dame made millions, Biggs made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions"
Drake,"April, spring is here and just like a spring, you start to spiral
May brings some warmer days, poolside, gettin' very tan"
Drake,"And when you boys got rich, you had to run from it
Cash blowin' Abel bread, out here trickin' (Out here trickin')"
Drake,"Oh shit, just follow me, right? 'Cause nothin' you sayin' could bother me, right?
I get off the plane and nothing has changed, I head to Delilah with all of my ice"
Drake,"We get that you think that you Bishop in Juice
When you put your hands on your girl, is it self-defense 'cause she bigger than you?"
Drake,"Riding...
She rode that dick like a soldier"
Drake,"That's why they need me out the way, what you expect?
Got a lot of blood and it's cold"
Drake,"Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
Yeah, and they never will"
Drake,"From smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'"
Drake,"And now she's texting me asking for closure, damn

Drake,"Now me and Chef, KD

Drake,"That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know
They loving the crew"
Drake,"All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg"
Drake,"No new niggas, nigga, we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?"
Drake,"Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs"
Drake,"Own that shit, you own that shit, go and
Own it, own it, own it, own it"
Drake,"Skrrt
And more chune for your headtop"
Drake,"Know ya, know ya got that thang that I like
Come through, come through, come through"
Drake,"Now I got a house in LA, now I got a bigger pool than Ye
And look man, Ye’s pool is nice, mine's just bigger's what I’m saying"
Drake,"When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me"
Drake,"The streets woulda had me hidin' out in a small town
My Montreal connects stand up, not fall down"
Drake,"Started from the bottom, now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom, now we're here"
Drake,"I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself"
Drake,"Heaven-sent, God-sent
Least that's what my mom says"
Drake,"How you feel about
Comin' home with a nigga for the night?"
Drake,"And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only ""hello"" or a ""happy belated"""
Drake,"And I hardly take offense
Money for revenge, man, that’s hardly an expense"
Drake,"I got the pedal to the floor
I'm on my motherfuckin' way, swangin'"
Drake,"When the last time you did somethin' for the first time?
You done done it all"

Drake,"SMS, triple X
That's the only time I ever shoot below the neck (Skrr)"
Drake,"Ayy

Drake,"We don't like to do too much explainin'
Story stayed the same through the money and the fame"
Drake,"I never went to bed, shit
Wine or water?"
Drake,"Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you at the show tonight?"
Drake,"You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?"
Drake,"If we may, we would just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational
Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years"
Drake,"I hear that shit all the time (All the time)
She said she love me"
Drake,"Tryna fight to the finish just to see, am I finished?
On my worst behavior, no?"
Drake,"I need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been
10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man"

Drake,"I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion"
Drake,"Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me"
Drake,"Nope, no way, nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave"
Drake,"I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you"
Drake,"Nigga callin' Top to see if Top wanna peace it up
""Top, wanna peace it up? Top, wanna peace it up?"""
Drake,"Hunnid thousand on my head, it's disrespect (Disrespect)
So offended that I had to double check"
Drake,"Stop buyin' views and bot comments, you may as well keep the paper
Shit you 'bout to need for later"
Drake,"Chris Breezy with the dance moves
Mo-G with the dance moves"
Drake,"'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearin' less and goin' out more"
Drake,"I'm too resilient, get out your feelings
It's gonna be a cruel summer for you"
Drake,"I want this shit forever, mane, 'ever, mane, 'ever, mane
Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans"
Drake,"Quavo, young nigga, I invented you (Ugh)
Ike Turner with the left hand (Ike)"
Drake,"These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free, Randy"
Drake,"Already had a Rolls Royce (On the road)
Sold a couple Bentley last week"
Drake,"Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition"
Drake,"It's supposed to be a lot of hard workin' goin' on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' goin' on?"
Drake,"And now your past is behind you like the car with the strap in it
Thank God that's finished"
Drake,"You love your friends, but somebody should've told you somethin'
To save you, instead, they say"
Drake,"The passion in the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talkin' about when we riot"
Drake,"Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself"
Drake,"She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time"
Drake,"I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand"
Drake,"Don't make me give you back
I say bounce that shit like woah"
Drake,"Nigga, don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me"
Drake,"You spent your last fifty (Ugh, cash)
I got the keys to the streets (Keys)"
Drake,"Wakin’ up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights"
Drake,"5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized"
Drake,"I coulda killed you the first time
You don’t have to try and say it louder, nigga"
Drake,"Call your number and it's out of service
Who can I call for your information?"
Drake,"Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume, 'cause I don't respect assumptions, babe"
Drake,"Uh, after hours at Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino"
Drake,"David Blaine last summer, man, you had to vanish
I get the hits like somebody pitchin' underhanded"

Drake,"To let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this
In this comfortable place"
Drake,"Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it"

From smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'"
Drake,"You know it, oh, you know it
Oh, you know it, we both know it"
Drake,"Niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, I’m charged up!"
Drake,"I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
Then it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check"
Drake,"Nigga, I said it, I know that you mad
I've emptied the clip over friendlier jabs"
Drake,"Talk to me, please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?"
Drake,"Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was
And never leave as myself"
Drake,"That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you"
Drake,"This is more than just a new lust for you, oh, oh
(Don't do that—)"
Drake,"'Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you"
Drake,"Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn somethin'"
Drake,"Uh, I was really, really tryna keep it—
Yeah"
Drake,"You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome"
Drake,"Windy city, she blowin' me kisses, no
Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight"
Drake,"Okay, look, I'm honest, girl, I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I'd commit to"
Drake,"'Fore the end of this year

Drake,"Worst behavior
Motherfuckers never loved us"
Drake,"They the type to stand in line for some free shit (Broke bitch)
Baby girl gon' suck it till her jaws locked (Suck it up)"
Drake,"I been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back"
Drake,"Oh, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me"
Drake,"Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up"
Drake,"I'm screamin' out ""YOLO,"" yeah, that's still the motto
I know I be on some shit that they ain't thought of"
Drake,"Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times"

Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uh"
Drake,"Get more love in the city that you from, nigga

Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle"

Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive"
Drake,"You requested it, so we rewind (6ix)
Yeah, way, way, way up (6ix)"
Drake,"Got a dance, but it's really on some street shit

How were there even comparisons made?"
Drake,"They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a karat cake, uh"

Drake,"I hit today, by tomorrow, she miss it
I grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it"
Drake,"Gotta hit the club, gotta make that ass jump
Gotta hit the club like you hit them mothafuckin' angles"
Drake,"Yeah, we just had to fix things, family, 6ix tings, we can't split up
As for the rest of the game, I'll do man dirty, man'll get two time"
Drake,"Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise"
Drake,"Got my mama out the basement (Mama)
That's a different type of face lift"
Drake,"Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga"
Drake,"You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know, whether it's disco and rock

Drake,"Wish you would learn to love people and use things
And not the other way around"
Drake,"Whole squad on that real shit

Don't be ashamed, it's plenty niggas that do what you do"
Drake,"Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language"

Everyday, I was strugglin' to learn what life's about"
Drake,"Drop a fifty bag, twenty-nine for the thot
Uh, I was really, really tryna keep it PG"
Drake,"He was, he— (Yeah)
He was once—"
Drake,"Girl, I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'"
Drake,"Says a lot about you if you not feeling us
The homie said, ""Hov, it ain't many of us"""
Drake,"We just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down"
Drake,"And since you pick up, I know he's not around
Are you drunk right now?"
Drake,"I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where I'd really be without that"
Drake,"Like a lab rat, nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home"
Drake,"I give you my voice
This song's for you"
Drake,"Made the world I know bigger
Changed the way that I viewed it"
Drake,"I got the drink in me, going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back"
Drake,"It’s sound, sound, sound ‘til the day I die
We goin' live to keep this shit alive"
Drake,"Clubbin' hard, fuckin' women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up on Biscayne"
Drake,"No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit go"
Drake,"Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga"
Drake,"Don't, tell me, I don't care if you hurt
I don't, tell you, you don't care if you're true"
Drake,"But you don't have the time to wait on me
I tried with you"
Drake,"And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it, oh"
Drake,"Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest""
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us"
Drake,"Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you"
Drake,"Dip 'cause it's mid, I can't fake like it's hangin'
Slimin' you out, I'm slimin' you out, I'm slimin' you out"
Drake,"And wishin' and wishin', they wishin' on me
Yeah, yeah"
Drake,"They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em"
Drake,"You would be a worthy competitor if I was really a predator
And you weren't fuckin' lying to every blogger and editor, but"
Drake,"They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Motherfucker never loved us"
Drake,"If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
Yeah, ah, yeah"
Drake,"My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'"
Drake,"You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it's just me, but I am not alone"
Drake,"Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her"
Drake,"Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin' different"
Drake,"And I'm down for you always
Look, the new me is really still the real me"
Drake,"Missin' out on my days
Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise"
Drake,"Own it
Own it"
Drake,"I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underaged"
Drake,"You can have her when I'm finished (Why?)
I hear the talk on road is I'm the shit, boy"
Drake,"Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold"
Drake,"This shit got me in my feelings
Gotta be real with it, ayy, yup"
Drake,"And I'm down for you always
D-down for you al–"
Drake,"'Cause if you're down (Back up, back up, and–)
I need a one dance (Where, where, where)"
Drake,"My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'
My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the bass is kickin'"
Drake,"Yeah
We got London on da Track"
Drake,"Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service"
Drake,"Like if Dave really fucked your girl and got her pregnant, talk about breedin' resentment
I'm not sure how to ease the sentiment, this shit's too intimate"
Drake,"All my young boys 'round me saying, ""Get money and fuck these hoes""
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you"
Drake,"I just seen the jet take off, they up to somethin'
Them boys just not bluffin', them boys just not bluffin'"
Drake,"Rock me real slowly (Yeah)
Put a bib on me"
Drake,"He was once—
Nah, fuck all of you niggas, I ain't finished"
Drake,"Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah"
Drake,"Got a dance, but it's really on some street shit
I'ma show you how to get it"
Drake,"Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse"
Drake,"Fucker never loved us
Worst behavior"
Drake,"I ain't even know you rapped still 'cause they only talkin' 'bout your 'fit again
Probably gotta have a kid again 'fore you think of droppin' any shit again"
Drake,"I let Ollie take the owl, told him brand it for me
I get 2 million a pop and that’s standard for me"
Drake,"This gun ain't gon' jam, when I blow, I ain't missin'
I'm droppin' hit after hit, I'm just chillin'"
Drake,"I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it"
Drake,"'Cause...
I love me"
Drake,"I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up"
Drake,"Where's the paperwork or the cabinet it's filed in?
1090 Jake woulda took all the walls down"
Drake,"I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give"
Drake,"Oh, the idea is so fun every time
At least we try for home run every time"
Drake,"Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways"
Drake,"Ayy
I could never be nobody number-one fan"
Drake,"If you still bumpin' R. Kelly, you could thank the Savior
Said if they deleted his music, then your music is goin' too, a hypocrite"
Drake,"I don't know nobody else that's doin' this
Bodies start to drop, ayy (Hit the floor)"
Drake,"What's that? Facts (Facts, nigga, yah)
Contract max, I gotta bring that shit back (Blah)"
Drake,"She rode it like a Melpomene soldier
She rode that dick like a soldier"
Drake,"I'll be here, just swanging (Ayy)
Don't talk to me like I'm famous (Ayy)"
Drake,"Girl, ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like
Girl, you got that thing for real"
Drake,"Yeah, that's 'cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga
Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just bein' frank with ya"
Drake,"They was hatin' on me then and they hatin' now (Hatin' now)
She was playin' with me then but she waitin' now (21, 21)"
Drake,"KB, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me"
Drake,"DM her, delete it, she my lil' secret
He tryna diss me to blow up, I peep it"
Drake,"That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome"
Drake,"Petal off a rose like I love her not, maybe not
I don't know what's wrong with me, I can't stop, woah, yeah"
Drake,"We must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for, but won't find"
Drake,"How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento"
Drake,"I think I killed everybody in the game last year
Man, fuck it, I was on, though"
Drake,"Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes I'm 'bout to take the hint from"
Drake,"Ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all-on't fuck with us, then we-on't fuck wit' ch'all"
Drake,"And you stuck right now, yeah (Stuck right now)
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl"
Drake,"You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas"
Drake,"Know ya got that thang that I like
Know ya, know ya got that thang that I like"
Drake,"(A song for y'all to cut up to, you know?)
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me (Yeah)"
Drake,"'Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin'"
Drake,"I would only go there 'cause niggas that I know there
Don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush"
Drake,"Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
0 to 100, nigga, real quick"
Drake,"Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house"
Drake,"Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say"
Drake,"You get high and do the most, yeah
How you let the kid fightin'"
Drake,"And, nigga, Cole losin' sleep on this, it ain't me
You better have some paperwork or that shit fake tea"
Drake,"We even gave y'all the whole money play and y'all broke to this day
“Oh it’s your time now” yeah, that’s what everybody say"
Drake,"Red wine over fed time
But shout out to the niggas that's doin' dead time"
Drake,"I'm just tryna connect with somethin', baby
I'll be here, just swanging (Ayy, ayy)"
Drake,"How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
'Cause you know I'm okay"
Drake,"And you know me
Turn the O2 into the O3, dog"
Drake,"Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch"
Drake,"I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?"
Drake,"I just wanna let you know that someone love you back
All the Cadillac like I'm Teddy Pendergrass"
Drake,"Where you get at me
All that grey in our conversation history, you"
Drake,"Fake fucked with me back then
But it's gettin' hard for you to fake it now"
Drake,"All me for real
Money on my mind? You should think the same"
Drake,"Yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then"
Drake,"Cool
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much"
Drake,"""If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue"
Drake,"Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you"
Drake,"Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you"
Drake,"Go and own that shit, own that shit
Own that shit, you own that shit, go and"
Drake,"Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
Girl, that's just some child's play"
Drake,"I take Eglinton to 401 East
And exit at Markham Road in the East End"
Drake,"But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place you can stick that in"
Drake,"Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle"
Drake,"Like controlla, controlla, yeah
And I’m never on a waste ting, shawty"
Drake,"Money for revenge, man, that’s hardly an expense
Al Haymon checks off of all of my events"
Drake,"'Member she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac"
Drake,"Can't let this one slide, ayy
Don't you wanna dance with me? No?"
Drake,"Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo"
Drake,"And I'm on the road, box office sales
I'm getting paid for all of this shit"
Drake,"Backstage in my city, it was friendzone
You won't ever take no chain off of us"
Drake,"Said if they deleted his music, then your music is goin' too, a hypocrite
I don't understand why these people praise ya"
Drake,"Show to the shower to the truck
Truck to the club for the party"
Drake,"It's yours, it's yours
Own it, own it, own it, own it"
Drake,"I'll be there, just swangin'
I'll be there, just swangin'"
Drake,"Yeah
Yeah, remember you was livin' at The London for a month"
Drake,"Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my, word to my—"
Drake,"The song sounds like an ode to a particular girl back in the Jungle who Drake struggles to stay... Read More
(Put a bib on me)"
Drake,"No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you"
Drake,"You know, compliments of the company
And we just laid back and did it"
Drake,"I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you"
Drake,"Then I hit ‘em with the Hotline
Chris Breezy with the dance moves"
Drake,"I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess? I should have stayed"
Drake,"But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass"
Drake,"Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me"
Drake,"I, I just love when I'm with you
Yeah, this shit is on ten"
Drake,"But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man"
Drake,"Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah"
Drake,"If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating, but it ain't working (Ain't working)"
Drake,"Hold up, hold my phone
Motherfuckers never loved us"
Drake,"Can't describe the pressure I be puttin' on myself, yeah
Really, I just can't afford to lose nobody else, yeah"
Drake,"Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop"
Drake,"If there's hell below, I'll see you when you get there
Are you enjoyin' yourselves?"
Drake,"This when your father leave you home alone with no protection, so neglected
That's why these pedophile raps and shit you so obsessed with, it's so excessive"
Drake,"Michael Phelps with the swim moves
Skrrt-skrrt, oh"
Drake,"Comin' live from the screwface, livin' out a suitcase
But I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates"
Drake,"All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end?
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then"
Drake,"Nope, no way, nah
Park the Benz just to ride the Wraith"
Drake,"I count all these racks that I have on me now, I'ma have you like, ""Woah""
Chanel N°9, Chanel N°5, well, you got 'em both"
Drake,"They ain't even wanna look up at the score
FaceTime with my shawty on tour"
Drake,"Southwest, no first class
Hilton rooms, gotta double up"
Drake,"Man, I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like, ""Is Bun coming?"
Drake,"Right or wrong, I'ma write my wrongs
They can't live this long"
Drake,"I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?"
Drake,"Oh, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different"
Drake,"Now you're talking down on my name (Ah), on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it"
Drake,"I swear to God, niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin' that I'm different these days"
Drake,"Murda on the beat so it's not nice
Yeah"
Drake,"If I die, all I know is I'm a mothafuckin' legend
It's too late for my city, I'm the youngest nigga reppin'"
Drake,"I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me"
Drake,"I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through"
Drake,"Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is? (Yours)"
Drake,"You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for"
Drake,"Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe
We gon' go live, we gon' go live, yep (Yeah, yeah)"
Drake,"I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you"
Drake,"You got issues that I won’t mention for now
’Cause we're fallin’ apart"
Drake,"I’m tryin' to take the high road, I still got love for my idols
I got me a deal with Apple and I still feel entitled"
Drake,"Are you drunk right now?
I'm just sayin' you could do better"
Drake,"Now the both of us are colorblind 'cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in a Boise state"
Drake,"10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man"
Drake,"Trouble neglect you
Angels protect you"
Drake,"Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you, yeah"
Drake,"Park the Benz just to ride the Wraith
Skrrt-skrrt"
Drake,"That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline"
Drake,"I always pour you up a drink and let you burn somethin'
Come through, come through, come through, come through"
Drake,"I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you"
Drake,"Like controlla, controlla, yeah
Okay, you like it, when I get"
Drake,"I need a one dance (Where, where, where)
Got a Hennessy in my hand (Where, where, where, where)"
Drake,"Don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize"
Drake,"Stay at the top like I'm stuck, that's just how I'm givin' it up
She wanna get married tonight"
Drake,"But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for"
Drake,"Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone"
Drake,"And still waking up like the rent's due (God)
Not complicated, it's simple"
Drake,"That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys"
Drake,"'Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just got paid like eight advances, goddamn"
Drake,"But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' goin' on?
Someone put a order in for a chicken (for a chicken)"
Drake,"This shit ain't no hundred bands (Nah, nah, nah, nah)
Palace look like Buckingham"
Drake,"More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution"
Drake,"I'm crackin' my shell now, they see that I'm smarter
I gotta get money, I love to get charter"
Drake,"I just been playin', I ain't even notice I was winnin'
And this is the only sound you should fear"
Drake,"Famous as fuck but I’m still in the cut when they round up the troops
I’m just a sicko, a real sicko when you get to know me, nigga"
Drake,"Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name"
Drake,"More life, more everything
Must have never had your phone tapped"
Drake,"Watch me, goin' out of the way, when I shoulda went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own"
Drake,"Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it"
Drake,"I see 'em tweakin', they know something's comin', woo
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to somethin', woo"
Drake,"Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up"
Drake,"I'm praying you recover from both incidents
But you a piece of shit, so this shit really no coincidence"
Drake,"And that fuckin' song y'all got did not start the beef with us
This shit been brewin' in a pot, now I'm heatin' up"
Drake,"Seen too much, it's so hard for me to let new people in
I can't change, this shit set in stone"
Drake,"Just hold on, we're going home
Just hold on, we're going home"
Drake,"Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck"
Drake,"You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it"
Drake,"Baby, I like your style
Grips on your waist, front way, back way"
Drake,"With no apology, if you nuh like we, we nuh like you neither youth
Your girl a say we cute, if you diss you will get execute"
Drake,"Now it's fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat
And I leave out and you call me and you tell me that you sorry"
Drake,"I took the team plane from Oracle
Mama never used to cook much"
Drake,"We ain’t even have a tour bus
Girls wouldn't even think of recordin’ me"
Drake,"Half a million on my head I can accept, yeah
'Least it makes me feel like someone tried their best, yeah"
Drake,"Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fuckin' with ya, damn
Is it the fall? Time for me to revisit the past"
Drake,"But still, I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings"
Drake,"I be dressed before we hung up
I take Eglinton to 401 East"
Drake,"I wanna know who mothafuckin' representin' in here tonight
Hold on, hold on"
Drake,"Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do"
Drake,"Bring that ass back
Trap, TrapMoneyBenny"
Drake,"That's word to my, word to my—
I'm so hot, yeah, I'm so right now (Right now)"
Drake,"Yeah
I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me"
Drake,"I'm just tryna connect with somethin', babe
Yeah, swanging"
Drake,"But then got no hits sound like they need me
My hooks did it, my lyrics did it"
Drake,"This is not to get confused
This one's for you"
Drake,"I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low"
Drake,"And say, ""I love you too""
But I need someone different"
Drake,"You tryna check?
This is real life, niggas think we playin' chess"
Drake,"Used to look up to a man from certain ends with tune on repeat
Thought he was a bad boy, then 'til man got pinched and man went PC"
Drake,"Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria"
Drake,"Hoes talk down, you don't see 'em outside
Yeah, they don't really be the same offline"
Drake,"Hunnid-fifty-inch screen in my bedroom
6'1"", man, a nigga need some leg room"
Drake,"It's a lot of bad things that they wishin' and wishin'
And wishin' and wishin', they wishin' on me"
Drake,"But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me"
Drake,"Scarborough ting from time, G
Been have up di ting dem from time, G"
Drake,"Zombie on the track
Started from the bottom, now we're here"
Drake,"I need someone to put this weight on
Fuck, I'm sorry"
Drake,"And as for Q, man, I changed his life a couple times
Nigga was at Kroger workin' double time"
Drake,"I don't take naps
Me and the money are way too attached to go and do that"
Drake,"Them boys up to somethin', they just not just bluffin'
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to somethin'"
Drake,"Them girls, they just wanna take my money
They don't want me to give you nothing"
Drake,"But I can't take a knee, 'cause I'm wearin' all white
Me and my broski are twins, but we don't look alike"
Drake,"Nah, pussy, now you on your own when you speakin' up
You done rolled deep to this, it's not fuckin' deep enough"
Drake,"I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all"
Drake,"I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown"
Drake,"Now they like, ""Aren't you adorable?""
I know the question rhetorical"
Drake,"'Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it, I ain't even gotta say it, they know"
Drake,"That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling"
Drake,"Don't pull up at 6 a.m. to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me"
Drake,"They loving the crew
They loving the crew"
Drake,"Do you right, do you right
I could fuck you so good, then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas"
Drake,"Drake is not a name that you gon' see on no sex offender list, Eazy-Duz-It
You mentionin' A minor, but niggas gotta B sharp and tell the fans, ""Who was it?"""
Drake,"Word to Flacko Jodye, he done seen us put it down
Niggas askin' if I'm cool"
Drake,"'Cause if I run the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended, but they smellin' defeat in the air"
Drake,"All I know, if I die, I'm a mothafuckin' legend
It's too late for my city, I'm the youngest nigga reppin'"
Drake,"And all she did was post pictures for people at home
'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known"
Drake,"And I can yell, girl, that you're crazy
Oh, what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy"
Drake,"I don't deserve her at all, no, not at all
I only text her, man, I never call"
Drake,"Take a shot for me (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
A shot for me (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)"
Drake,"I'm droppin' hit after hit, I'm just chillin'
But I'll send a hit while I chill with my children"
Drake,"You said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that"
Drake,"Own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it"
Drake,"'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always"
Drake,"Man, motherfuckers never loved us
Worst behavior"
Drake,"That's the only kind of shit that gets you some respect
Got a lot of blood and it's cold"
Drake,"Nope, no way, nah
Park the Benz just to ride the Wraith"
Drake,"My new girl is on Glee and shit
Prolly making mo' money than me and shit"
Drake,"Ya dun know, eh?
It's a OVO ting, eh?"
Drake,"Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road"
Drake,"But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh, baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her"
Drake,"I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things"
Drake,"You gon' make me call my bros for assistance
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'"
Drake,"Michael was prayin' his features would change so people believe that he's actually white
Top would make you do features for change, get on pop records and rap for the whites"
Drake,"Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yute while I was writin’ Views"
Drake,"I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to, I got a compound"
Drake,"Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?
I got a 150,000 dollars for an afterparty"
Drake,"Look at you, look at you and look at you
Aww, I'm glad that they chose us"
Drake,"Now I'm more in touch with the music
You said, either way, I'd be a star, I could go so far"
Drake,"You give, but you cannot take love
Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G"
Drake,"That's for sure, that's for sure
How you feel about"
Drake,"Those that get laughed at sit off in a corner
Like a lab rat, nobody want her"
Drake,"I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see"
Drake,"Yeah, way, way, way up (6ix)
Turn it all up"
Drake,"Knew I was the man by the age of six
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit"
Drake,"Who is it that's got you all gassed up? (Yeah)
Changin' your opinion on me"
Drake,"Maroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty
Then we need a verse for the Swifties"
Drake,"I just build and build more, y'all niggas build to destroy
Y'all niggas party too much, man, I just chill and record"
Drake,"Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
They want me gone (Gone, blah), wait for the kicker"

Without a follow, without a mention"
Drake,"Yeah, I couldn't get a bill paid
You couldn't buy the real thing"
Drake,"You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity"
Drake,"From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate"
Drake,"We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know"
Drake,"Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it"
Drake,"But I don't really buy it
Me? I'm movin' quiet, all the things we're tryin'"
Drake,"Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on"
Drake,"Baby, don't you wanna dance with me? No?
I could dance like Michael Jackson"

Drake,"It's been that way from the beginnin'
I just been playin', I ain't even notice I was winnin'"
Drake,"Say you'll never ever leave from beside me

Drake,"Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it"
Drake,"In my Bugatti, I took the key and tried to hide it
So you can't drive it, and put on mileage"
Drake,"Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities"
Drake,"Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive"
Drake,"'Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself, ""Why do you worry?"""
Drake,"And he knew, knows how to get in touch with you now
To let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this"
Drake,"Yeah, ayy, ayy
She say, ""Do you love me?"" I tell her, ""Only partly"

If I ain't got a weapon, I'ma pick up a rock"
Eminem,"Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him, and fuck you too"
Eminem,"(Na-na-na, na, na, na, na)
I've created a monster"
Eminem,"End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones"
Eminem,"Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call"
Eminem,"Ayo
This song is for anyone"
Eminem,"I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin', I'm tryna stop you from leavin'"
Eminem,"Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone"
Eminem,"Sometimes, I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders, no wonder"
Eminem,"Just keep marchin', 'til we reach congress
But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance"
Eminem,"New-hoo, ooh-hoo
Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that"
Eminem,"I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand, and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get"
Eminem,"I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds"
Eminem,"All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn"
Eminem,"Is more than twice than a black life span
I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner"
Eminem,"Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back"
Eminem,"Stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy"
Eminem,"Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder, ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?"""
Eminem,"I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me)
Until the roof, until the roof"
Eminem,"We clutch, it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us"
Eminem,"I'm afraid to unlock it (Nah)
Keep those monsters in the closet"
Eminem,"Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis"
Eminem,"Spit fire, bitch, I was just flyin' coach (Yeah)
Y'all thought you were sick, you were misdiagnosed (Nope)"
Eminem,"I hope your conscience eats at you, and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim, shut up, bitch! I'm tryna talk"
Eminem,"You'd love me
Forever"
Eminem,"Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan"
Eminem,"Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped"
Eminem,"You're tryin' to save me
Stop holdin' your breath"
Eminem,"Three to the one, from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D"
Eminem,"I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, ""Die, Shady!"", and pop it"
Eminem,"I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you, squeezin'
'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick, ain't no possible reason"
Eminem,"That I won't be makin' a mistake 'cause I'm a
I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon"
Eminem,"But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)"
Eminem,"Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away"
Eminem,"You can leave this earth, bitch, I'm in rake mode (Huh)
I'm in cake mode (Huh), I'm in brave mode, uh"
Eminem,"To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad"
Eminem,"Nickel-plated twenty-two, two, two
Bitch, shut the fuck up 'fore I shoot you too"
Eminem,"For you to go against me is simply insane, you will die (Yeah)
That's why they call me Kamikaze, it's plain suicide, yeah"
Eminem,"I just sneeze, but I just go achoo then a-chieve
This is survival of the fittest"
Eminem,"With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school"
Eminem,"Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'"
Eminem,"Or maybe you do
But if I'm embarrassin' me, I'm embarrassin' you and don't you dare say it isn't true"
Eminem,"Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?"
Eminem,"Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?"
Eminem,"First off, you don't know Marshall
At all, so don't grow partial"
Eminem,"And if you don't like me, then fuck you
Self-esteem must be fuckin' shootin' through the roof, 'cause trust me"
Eminem,"As I begin to fuckin' devour the track
And you backpedal, that is a cowardly act"
Eminem,"It wasn't meant to cause you grief
Regardless, it was wrong of me, but"
Eminem,"Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who"", ""Yeah, but he's so cute though"""
Eminem,"If I hear another word so don't go openin' your jibs
'Cause every time you do it's like an overload of fibs"
Eminem,"Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face"
Eminem,"That they can't even figure out where their words
Should hit the kick and the snare"
Eminem,"Please stand up, please stand up?
I'm like a head trip to listen to"
Eminem,"I wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops
The block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot"
Eminem,"Right at you
So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want"
Eminem,"I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream ""Fuck you!"""
Eminem,"We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do
And at the time I was goin' through my own struggles too"
Eminem,"And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV"
Eminem,"Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt)
I'm lookin' fo' a girl I can fuck in my Hummer truck"
Eminem,"And sendin' it to masterin' to make it loud
Enough dirt on you to murder you"
Eminem,"Give out from underneath me, I
I will not fall, I will stand tall"
Eminem,"'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all"
Eminem,"These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings"
Eminem,"Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow"
Eminem,"So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals"
Eminem,"Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
That's what we call 'em pigsties for"
Eminem,"Swear I can see the game from a bird's-eye view, ayy
Bitch, you talkin' to a rap god, ayy"
Eminem,"Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm"
Eminem,"""I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad"
Eminem,"With another anthem – why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough"
Eminem,"When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was White
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like"
Eminem,"I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled onto you, musta been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take?"
Eminem,"I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly"
Eminem,"But the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live
The less is left for closure, so let's let this go"
Eminem,"They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)"
Eminem,"'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me"
Eminem,"Y'all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit
If you'da put D12 on it, wish I coulda did"
Eminem,"But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)"
Eminem,"But I pray you see tomorrow, little boy, you gon' learn
Never sold dope for no gold rope"
Eminem,"We ain't the same, you and I
Somebody should have explained to you why"
Eminem,"Walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own"
Eminem,"Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman"
Eminem,"Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
Some girls, they act retarded"
Eminem,"Call the attack dogs off of us, man
You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop"
Eminem,"You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno"
Eminem,"Shake that ass for me, ah, girl
Shake that ass for me"
Eminem,"And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey"
Eminem,"They call me Kanye crazy (Yah)
Apeshit, Beyoncé, JAY-Z (Woo)"
Eminem,"It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'"
Eminem,"No español, I'm allergic to rojo and legally blind, all I'm seein' is ""go""
D to the A, there and back, if we ride with the Drac', can't smoke from the T to the O"
Eminem,"Up in my Tesla, I'm rollin' up 'Ishers, I stopped at Valero, think I should quit smokin'
Life is a gamble and I'm playin' slots, pull it down, close my eyes and I pray I win tokens"
Eminem,"Maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features
But that's water under the bridge"
Eminem,"Fuck your Republican views
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?"
Eminem,"I paid attention, don't need no payola
Can't take 'way from me, you just need to take cover (Frr)"
Eminem,"I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out? I'll put you out"
Eminem,"Includin' the voicemails right before you flipped your top
When me and Luis were tryin' to stick two CDs in the same slot"
Eminem,"I walk on water
But only when it freezes"
Eminem,"And wholeheartedly, apologies, Rihanna
For that song that leaked, I'm sorry, Ri"
Eminem,"Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away"
Eminem,"Nobody knows me, I'm cold
Walk down this road all alone"
Eminem,"Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady"
Eminem,"Channelin' my anger through every single station that's on!
'Cause a woman broke my he-art, I say, ""he-art"""
Eminem,"They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world"
Eminem,"Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Haha)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long"
Eminem,"Even while sleepin', be thinkin' so woke
White Cartiers, all I'm seein' is dope"
Eminem,"Nothin' without you, and I'd believe
I'm shot in the lungs, I gasp, I can't breathe"
Eminem,"See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her"
Eminem,"So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end"
Eminem,"I will always be here, but that spark isn't there
And I don't know how to recapture that time and that era"
Eminem,"""Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket"
Eminem,"La-la, la-la-la
La-la, la-la-la"
Eminem,"""Daddy, look what I made!"" ""Dad's gotta go catch a plane""
""Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?"""
Eminem,"Think I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink
Hop on the freeway tryna get some time alone and just think"
Eminem,"And I'd cry and I'd scream, ""Baby, please don't leave!""
Snatch the keys from your hand, I would squeeze"
Eminem,"What, you Mariah? Fly through twice
But I do know one thing though"
Eminem,"If I had something on you I woulda did it by now
Oh, on the contrary, Mary Poppins, I'm mixin' our studio session down"
Eminem,"And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh"
Eminem,"To these kids you no longer exist
Went from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch"
Eminem,"And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
Right at you"
Eminem,"It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
‘Cause if you coulda took my life you woulda"
Eminem,"As I got a little bit older, my hate
Was making me get cold, and began to get a chipped shoulder"
Eminem,"That's under my bed
Get along with the voices"
Eminem,"I told him how you like it from behind
(Now) Shake that ass for me"
Eminem,"So, please don't wake me from this dream, baby
We're still together in my head"
Eminem,"New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, ooh-hoo"
Eminem,"'Cause she ripped it in two pa-arts and threw it in the garbage
Who do you think you a-are? Bitch, guess it's time for me to get the dust off"
Eminem,"Been with you guys thick and thin
But it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends"
Eminem,"And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days"
Eminem,"I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman"
Eminem,"'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse"
Eminem,"And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?"
Eminem,"This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all"
Eminem,"It'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what
Got me this far, picture me quittin'"
Eminem,"Just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can—"
Eminem,"'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth"
Eminem,"A Freudian slip, subconsciously, I honestly wished
I ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment"
Eminem,"I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed"
Eminem,"You're tryin' to save me
Stop holdin' your breath"
Eminem,"And then this thought just popped in my head (You made me like this way)
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier"
Eminem,"Help me leave this all behind
I'ma wash away my sins"
Eminem,"""But, baby, wait!"" ""It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us"
Eminem,"Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer-park girls go round the outside"
Eminem,"You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow, little boy, you gon' learn"
Eminem,"Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask"
Eminem,"I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and I'm comin' straight at"
Eminem,"'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been makin' my mistakes, oh, if you only knew"
Eminem,"And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight"
Eminem,"We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt)"
Eminem,"I can paint a picture like I made the stencil
Fuck your whole image, I'm with Cole Bennett"
Eminem,"And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other"
Eminem,"Check your wine cellar, look at the amounts of all the wine
Like I fuckin' sit around and think about you all the time"
Eminem,"'Cause I don't really got shit else, so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest"
Eminem,"It's more like billy clubs and gats
And we really love it when you think we're guilty ‘cause we're black"
Eminem,"(I'm Mary Poppins, baby) And I'm Superman, ooh
(Mary P; Slim Shady) Comin' at you"
Eminem,"I'm barely chartin' myself
Feels like I'm on the descent, but it was not my intent"
Eminem,"Stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy"
Eminem,"We're gonna have a problem here
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before"
Eminem,"And my boy, and his boy
And his boy"
Eminem,"And be proud to be out of your mind and out of control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?"
Eminem,"Sit back, homie, relax, in fact, grab a six pack
Kick back while I kick facts, yeah, Dre—sick track"
Eminem,"(Yo, left, yo, left) You feel like you wanna just give up
(Yo, left, right, left) But you gotta search within you"
Eminem,"Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Woo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee"
Eminem,"Slim Shady, artful dodger
(I love you) I love you, too"
Eminem,"Tobey Maguire got bit by a spider, but see, me, it was a goat
If you want space, I hope you take your helmet off soon as you get up to Venus and choke"
Eminem,"With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)"
Eminem,"It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink"
Eminem,"'Cause I been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil, spell it backwards, I'll show ya"
Eminem,"One of one, sittin' 'round the stars, double R, finna race, yeah, the Wraith like a spaceship, it's floatin'
All this drip, think I am below sea level"
Eminem,"If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me"
Eminem,"But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back
Give me the mic, show me where the fuckin' studio's at"
Eminem,"On my last rock, for my slingshot
Better haul ass, don't be no slow poke (Nope)"
Eminem,"Throw your ass in the van cuffed
You don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are"
Eminem,"Girl, you talkin' to a monsta, ayy
You could give your whole damn life to the music thing"
Eminem,"Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady"
Eminem,"Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?"
Eminem,"And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted"
Eminem,"It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now, let's go, just give me the signal"
Eminem,"To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)"
Eminem,"A multitude of homies who would pounce for no good excuse
We were so bulletproof—wrote, souped, and soaked in our youth"
Eminem,"I won't topple, I'm giving it to anyone who wanna come and get it and I'm not gonna stop
But when they ask me is the war finished with MGK? Of course it is"
Eminem,"That's under my bed
Get along with the voices"
Eminem,"The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control"
Eminem,"Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop"
Eminem,"The ""Speedom"" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?"
Eminem,"Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, come on, girl"
Eminem,"New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, ooh-hoo"
Eminem,"I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me)
Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get"
Eminem,"*Plane crash*
Yeah (Illa, Illa, Illa)"
Eminem,"Y'all call this fame, I call this shit alcoholistic infamy
Targettin' my kids and babies through population and gun control"
Eminem,"So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else, so that shit helps when I'm depressed"
Eminem,"""Melle Mel shouldn't get no reply"" (What?)
""That man is a legend,"" bitch, so am I (Haha, yeah)"
Eminem,"Wanted someone to die
So bad in my fuckin' life"
Eminem,"Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin"
Eminem,"(It's the curse of the—, it's the curse of the—)
I walk on water (Shit)"
Eminem,"Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo"
Eminem,"And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?"
Eminem,"But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go"
Eminem,"I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver"
Eminem,"Stop it, cutting off your oxygen
And I hit them pads like a boxing gym"
Eminem,"I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you"
Eminem,"And pick myself up off the carpet
But I'll never say the L-word again"
Eminem,"All of whom I'm a father to
I'm a God to you, y'all better worship the water I walk on"
Eminem,"Single mother strugglin' through substance abuse
While people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes"
Eminem,"'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse"
Eminem,"'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, ""This shit is garbage"""
Eminem,"Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late""
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door"
Eminem,"I'm a hair away from gettin' carried away and gettin' sued
I was gonna stop at sixteen, that was thirty-two"
Eminem,"Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic"
Eminem,"But when they ask me is the war finished with MGK? Of course it is
I cleansed him of his mortal sins, I'm God and the Lord forgives even the devil worshippers"
Eminem,"'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya"
Eminem,"Don't take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
The poverty that we face so the crime rate's the highest in"
Eminem,"My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead"
Eminem,"Better shut your lyin' mouth if you don't want Nick findin' out
You probably think 'cause it's been so long"
Eminem,"In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe"
Eminem,"André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy"
Eminem,"End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones"
Eminem,"Popped it back in and hopped up like, ""Fuck it (Fuck it)
Best two out of three"", yeah"
Eminem,"(New-hoo, ooh-hoo) Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think it went wanderin' off down"
Eminem,"(Yo, I want everybody to listen to the words of this song)
I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see"
Eminem,"Don't ask me why I have no love for these motherfuckin' hoes
Bloodsuckin' succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?"
Eminem,"I repeat
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?"
Eminem,"So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang"
Eminem,"'Cause you told me
You'd love me"
Eminem,"'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest"
Eminem,"And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh"
Eminem,"I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together, think about it"
Eminem,"(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum"
Eminem,"And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh)"
Eminem,"A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
Now, this looks like a job for me"
Eminem,"Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it wit' ya"""
Eminem,"And you're still in love with me
'Til I woke up to discover that that dream was dead"
Eminem,"Wow Mariah, didn't expect you to go balls out
Bitch, shut the fuck up 'fore I put all them phone calls out"
Eminem,"Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention, please"""
Eminem,"'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps ('Til my legs, until my legs)
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me)"
Eminem,"And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the *galf* and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker"
Eminem,"Watch your motherfuckin' mouth 'fore I go in it
They like, ""No, he didn't,"" got 'em more invested"
Eminem,"I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?"
Eminem,"'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not, you only get one shot"
Eminem,"'Cause this is somethin' that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me, then fuck you"
Eminem,"I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick"
Eminem,"Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me"
Eminem,"Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway"
Eminem,"Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm"
Eminem,"La-la, la-la
Kids"
Eminem,"There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's gonna be that one?"
Eminem,"You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you"
Eminem,"'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating"
Eminem,"The song was... Read More
Hands up, officer don't shoot"
Eminem,"Let's do the math: If I was Black, I would've sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that"
Eminem,"Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
Dr. Dre said, ""Hell yeah!"""
Eminem,"And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey"
Eminem,"On for entire careers 'cause that's not even fair
I will always be here, but that spark isn't there"
Eminem,"I've seen them come and go
I've seen the hugest (Hugest) debuts ('Buts)"
Eminem,"'Til I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence
Straight out the tube, right into your livin' rooms I came"
Eminem,"All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up"
Eminem,"But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me"
Eminem,"My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake-bitten with my—venom"
Eminem,"Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'"
Eminem,"Neck wet, big drip, I'm in rain mode (Drip, drip, drip)
Eight niggas, eight hittas, take eight souls (Brrr)"
Eminem,"'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me"
Eminem,"They like, ""No, he didn't,"" got 'em more invested
If it's one thing I make, I make no exceptions"
Eminem,"You used to say that I'd never be
Nothin' without you, and I'd believe"
Eminem,"I take the chances you hate takin'
Fuck it, dog, I'ma go Wes Craven"
Eminem,"I'm a clown like John Wayne Gacy (What?)
They call me Kanye crazy (Yah)"
Eminem,"But I pray you see tomorrow, little boy, you gon' learn
Pray you see tomorrow, little boy, you gon' learn"
Eminem,"Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble"
Eminem,"I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him"
Eminem,"To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care"
Eminem,"So to the parents of America, I am the Derringer
Aimed at little Erica to attack her character"
Eminem,"So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?"
Eminem,"I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating"
Eminem,"'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike"
Eminem,"And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in"
Eminem,"Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?"
Eminem,"Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet"
Eminem,"(It's true—)
'Cause I'm only human, just like you"
Eminem,"I ain't sayin' this shit again, ho, you know what it is
It's a warning shot, 'fore I blow up your whole spot"
Eminem,"After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin' to blossom
So now I'm catchin' the flak from these activists when they raggin'"
Eminem,"They'll be calling you a trash bin
Sayin' that your new one isn't better than your last and"
Eminem,"Now I just sit back and watch them bills pile up (Haha), but
I be on my own (Yeah, woo), head up in the clouds like Zeus"
Eminem,"I'm like my skin is it startin' to work to my benefit now? It's—
White America, I could be one of your kids"
Eminem,"Take me to the river
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
Eminem,"Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders, no wonder
You're losin' your mind, the way it wanders"
Eminem,"Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom, and buy you a wardrobe"
Eminem,"Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rin-inse"
Eminem,"And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy"
Eminem,"Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack"
Eminem,"I was immersed in the Murcié, I show 'em no mercy, I really was watchin' the throne (For real)
Niggas ain't turnin' me down, when my baby asleep only time that I'm watchin' my tone, look (Shh)"
Eminem,"Swish, but don't spit it; swallow it and now finish, yeah
Me and Nate D-o-double-g"
Eminem,"Oh did I say ""whore,"" Nick? I meant a liar too (Ha)
Like I've been goin' off on you all this time"
Eminem,"Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on)
Sing it with me, it's just for today"
Eminem,"And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to"
Eminem,"So when I get back on my feet, don't wonder why in the
Fuck is my head in the clouds (Nah)"
Eminem,"Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up"
Eminem,"But I hate you (Uh), ‘cause you drained me (Uh)
I gave you all, you gave me none"
Eminem,"If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am"
Eminem,"And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, ""Baby, please don't leave!"""
Eminem,"And the doctor's operating (What?)
But he never put no scrubs on from Snoop, K. Dot to Shady"
Eminem,"That's under my bed
Get along with the voices"
Eminem,"They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world"
Eminem,"That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it 'cause we consider these minutes golden"
Eminem,"Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill"
Eminem,"The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!""
Shout to all my colorblind people"
Eminem,"Shake that ass for me, come on, girl
Shake that ass for me"
Eminem,"'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothin' for me to fall back on, I know no other trade"
Eminem,"Real, real, real, murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill
Nickel-plated twenty-two, two, two"
Eminem,"When they say, ""You ain't the GOAT"", I come down like, ""Who?""
But I got my head in the clouds like Zeus"
Eminem,"And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me"
Eminem,"So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in"
Eminem,"But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider"
Eminem,"With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up"
Eminem,"Sexy as can be
Tonight, I want a slut, would you be mine?"
Eminem,"Bitch, shut the fuck up 'fore I shoot you too
Ain't shit I won't do just to get a few YouTube views"
Eminem,"Down to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind"
Eminem,"You want what you can't have
Ooh girl, that's too damn bad"
Eminem,"'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in"
Eminem,"Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive"
Eminem,"Wrote ""DSM"" on the beach, now the sand stamped
Boy"
Eminem,"You're gonna need three squads of police officers at least to come pull me off of it and I don't stop
Please, dog, I need y'all to keep talking shit 'cause I feed off of it"
Eminem,"I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get (Yo)
White America, I could be one of your kids"
Eminem,"'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman"
Eminem,"Swear I can see the game from a bird's-eye view, ayy
Bitch, you talkin' to a rap god, ayy"
Eminem,"I'm a product of properly hoppin' up out of that poverty
Profitin' all for coppin' and swappin' that property out for a possible monopoly"
Eminem,"So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?"
Eminem,"Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
No one's ever indicted you"
Eminem,"I said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh"
Eminem,"And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
Where were the parents at?"
Eminem,"'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose"
Eminem,"Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds"
Eminem,"Put it to my brain, scream, ""Die, Shady!"", and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes"
Eminem,"Inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me"
Eminem,"'Cause Congress keep tellin' me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government"
Eminem,"Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass"
Eminem,"We're still together in my head
And you're still in love with me"
Eminem,"Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him"
Eminem,"We'll see how much you'll be partyin' then
You don't want that, neither do I"
Eminem,"Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on a Starter cap"
Eminem,"When I'm with you, I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't with you, I have zero strength"
Eminem,"'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Makin' my mistakes, oh, if you only knew"
Eminem,"Higher up on a list than me (Ha)
Yet, here I sit on your list though at five (Hm), which though is fine"
Eminem,"Like I'm outside of an Ariana Grande concert waiting
They call me Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini"
Eminem,"Them hips and licked them lips, and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit"
Eminem,"‘Cause on the inside you're ugly and mad
But you're all that I love, I grasp, you can't leave"
Eminem,"I latch onto you like a—parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life"
Eminem,"The morning rain clouds up my window (Window)
And I can't see at all"
Eminem,"White America, Little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit"
Eminem,"Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—
I'm friends with the monster"
Eminem,"It's lust, it's torturous
You must be a sorceress"
Eminem,"Remember when we met in Denver? You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither"
Eminem,"And love is evil, spell it backwards, I'll show ya
Nobody knows me, I'm cold"
Eminem,"Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman
Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes"
Eminem,"But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable"
Eminem,"I avoid Cupid, stupid! Wasn't for blow jobs, you'd be unemployed
Oye-yoy-yoy, man-oh-man, your boy-boy-boys"
Eminem,"For you to see so damn much of my ass, you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na"
Eminem,"I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt"
Eminem,"But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous"
Eminem,"I just want some face but this is no facial (Ooh)
Do right and kill everybody, Drake mode (Hello)"
Eminem,"Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
So how can we have higher standards?"
Eminem,"And I know they're gonna hate
But I don't care, I barely can wait"
Eminem,"Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm"
Eminem,"I'll take 'em all out, I hope you hear this song
And go into a cardiac arrest, have a heart attack and just"
Eminem,"You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it"
Eminem,"When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field"
Eminem,"A subconscious racist
Wait, why are there black neighborhoods?"
Eminem,"So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once"
Eminem,"Get along with the voices
Inside of my head"
Eminem,"Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath"
Eminem,"(Yo, left, yo, left) And not be a quitter
(Yo, left, right, left) No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse"
Eminem,"And when I bust yo' ass, I'm gon' continue to rock
Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet"
Eminem,"Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman"
Eminem,"And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me"
Eminem,"New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, ooh-hoo"
Eminem,"White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get"
Eminem,"It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her"
Eminem,"And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey"
Eminem,"Boy
Ayy, ayy"
Eminem,"And I'll be the third person who screwed you today
Oh, fourth—Dre, Drake, Lupe—ooh, touché"
Eminem,"May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?"
Eminem,"Watch unc' break a rock down to three pebbles
Bam-bam, down three, hit the grand slam"
Eminem,"Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back"
Eminem,"Profitin' all for coppin' and swappin' that property out for a possible monopoly
Tryin' not to adopt my father's old philosophies"
Eminem,"Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adiós
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though"
Eminem,"'Cause I'm hanging up this phone, boo, you make my fuckin' Bluetooth ache
You're feeling blue? Too late, go smurf yourself"
Eminem,"Pullin' myself out of the dumps once again
I'm gettin' up once and for all—fuck this shit!"
Eminem,"And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner"
Eminem,"Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the
First time since you left"
Eminem,"Tip of the backwood is where the flame goes (There)
To the sky is where my brain goes (Wow)"
Eminem,"They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh)
It's the return of the ""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding"
Eminem,"Well, that's nothin'
New-hoo, ooh-hoo"
Eminem,"That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold for you, for four hours, and you just said, ""no"""
Eminem,"Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em"
Eminem,"‘Cause I'm stronger than I was
You walked out, I almost died"
Eminem,"I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman"
Eminem,"Because they're so easy to see through 'em (See through 'em)
But a fighter's all I knew how to be"
Eminem,"Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday (Yeah-yeah)"
Eminem,"The poverty that we face so the crime rate's the highest in
The lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence"
Eminem,"Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit)
Sing it with me, it's just for today"
Eminem,"Two years, but you left on the 1st of May
I wrote it on a calendar, was gonna call"
Eminem,"And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall"
Eminem,"I hate complaining, I hated waiting, I'll pay for patience
But I hate to pay a bill (Hate that)"
Eminem,"Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith"
Eminem,"To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion of you
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news"
Eminem,"She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
""You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?"""
Eminem,"And diplomatic as I'm tryna be
Last thing I need is Snoop doggin' me"
Eminem,"How could it ever be just us two?
I'd never love you enough to trust you"
Eminem,"I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh)"
Eminem,"If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am"
Eminem,"Yet, here I sit on your list though at five (Hm), which though is fine
But just know inside, to me, this shit's hilarious, so when I (Haha)"
Eminem,"I will pop up and I'll take a spot from you
I'll get to doing what a leaky faucet do"
Eminem,"Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews"
Eminem,"Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew
I was hopin' they do, so I ain't have to shoulder the crew"
Eminem,"'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?"
Eminem,"Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart"
Eminem,"I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh"
Eminem,"Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown"
Eminem,"Ride around with the Iron Giant, make 'em eat metal
Watch unc' break a rock down to three pebbles"
Eminem,"Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (Window)"
Eminem,"""That man is a legend,"" bitch, so am I (Haha, yeah)
And anyone else who thinks it'd be wise and easy as pie"
Eminem,"'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse"
Eminem,"Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm"
Eminem,"I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word"
Eminem,"White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, Little Eric looks just like this"
Eminem,"They said I was washed-up and got a bloodbath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter: I can adjust"
Eminem,"And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin'
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings (Ch, puh)"
Eminem,"It's no one's fault but my own
It's the path I've chosen to go"
Eminem,"Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em"
Eminem,"So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all"
Eminem,"And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go"
Eminem,"Those were the days but I bet you, I'm never gonna be broke again, no
I don't smoke, but I got paper, to be blunt, I'm rolling in dough"
Eminem,"Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum"
Eminem,"'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps"
Eminem,"Yeah, her ass fake, but she came for real (She came, uh)
Money ain't a thing, that ain't a thing for real (What is that?)"
Eminem,"In the paper, the news, everyday I am
(Ha) I don't know, that's just the way I am"
Eminem,"A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not"
Eminem,"My city Leia and I'm Obi-Wan, got a mission to pass, I just might be the hope
Tobey Maguire got bit by a spider, but see, me, it was a goat"
Eminem,"How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then"
Eminem,"That I still have pictures? However you prefer to do
And that goes for Nick too, faggot, you think I'm scurred of you?"
Eminem,"Where does the pain go? (Where?)
Tip of the backwood is where the flame goes (There)"
Eminem,"We just met and I just fucked you
But I do know one thing though"
Eminem,"Some girls, they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it"
Eminem,"Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm"
Eminem,"Last thing I need is Snoop doggin' me
Man, Dogg, you was like a (Yeah) damn god to me"
Eminem,"From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may"
Eminem,"Lions, tigers, and bears, oh my
It's more like billy clubs and gats"
Eminem,"But I'm contemplating yelling ""Bombs away"" on the game
Like I'm outside of an Ariana Grande concert waiting"
Eminem,"The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?"
Eminem,"'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Who would've thought standin' in this mirror, bleachin' my hair"
Eminem,"And can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops
I wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops"
Eminem,"You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'"
Eminem,"And slap you 'til you can't stand
Girl, you just blew your chance"
Eminem,"Shit, fuck, shit
Boy, huh"
Eminem,"The world's coming to an end, I don't even care
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar"
Eminem,"I've had a great view to see the (See the) game through (Through)
And Drake, they're gonna turn on you (You) one day too (Too)"
Eminem,"(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
I said knock knock, let the devil in"
Eminem,"'Rot In Pieces', uh, that's great""
First off, you don't know Marshall"
Eminem,"Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt, 'cause—"
Eminem,"Pray you see tomorrow, little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn"
Eminem,"So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up"
Eminem,"Yeah, it's my life (Hey, Hailie)
In my own words, I guess"
Eminem,"Better haul ass, don't be no slow poke (Nope)
Through the tall grass, run your ass off (Yeah)"
Eminem,"We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'"
Eminem,"And bust all over your belly and you almost started hurling
And said I was gross, go get a towel, your stomach's curling"
Eminem,"Y'all thought you were sick, you were misdiagnosed (Nope)
I'm dope and you'll never have this high a dose (Nope, yeah)"
Eminem,"'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho
'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman"
Eminem,"Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss"
Eminem,"And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm"
Eminem,"But this, to me, is a mystery
How rappers I've already ripped could be (What?)"
Eminem,"Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida"
Eminem,"We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend"
Eminem,"So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy"
Eminem,"'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'"
Eminem,"New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, ooh-hoo"
Eminem,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's 2002, everything was totally new"
Eminem,"Collect pesos (Huh), and I'm paid, so? (Paid)
Self-made goals (Hey)"
Eminem,"'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools"
Eminem,"Listen, girly, surely you don't want me to talk about how I nutted early
'Cause I ejaculated prematurely"
Eminem,"Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me (Sing), sing for the year (Sing it)"
Eminem,"I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl"
Eminem,"Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it
In your back, then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you"
Eminem,"I'm lookin' fo' a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say, every day she be givin' it up"
Eminem,"I'm some wigga who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls"
Eminem,"Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back"
Eminem,"And Dr. Dre said
Nothing, you idiots, Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha-ha)"
Eminem,"I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper"
Eminem,"And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me"
Eminem,"Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar
Seems like the average lifespan of a white man"
Eminem,"Off of this chest, and I rest again peacefully
But at least have the decency in you"
Eminem,"But only when it freezes
'Cause I'm only human, just like you"
Eminem,"Lookin' for a couple bitches with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's"
Eminem,"But fuck it, now I'm 'bout to draw the line
And for you to cross it that's a mountain that I doubt you wanna climb"
Eminem,"I'd rather hear 'em say ""Die N-word"" than Die Antwoord
Ninja, now it's better disguised banter"
Eminem,"L-L-L-Like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago"
Eminem,"D to the A, there and back, if we ride with the Drac', can't smoke from the T to the O
Upped than a bitch, you can keep what you owe"
Eminem,"Oh, this what we doin'? Alright
M.A"
Eminem,"Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't
At the time, no one could hurt me like you coulda"
Eminem,"I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed"
Eminem,"(Now) Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, come on, girl"
Eminem,"I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better"
Eminem,"But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph"
Eminem,"Through your living room window
Take your Nintendo and then skate"
Eminem,"Which reminded me, Biz, ""Rockstar"" was the shit
Y'all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit"
Eminem,"Is that supposed to be me in the video with the goatee?
Wow Mariah, didn't expect you to go balls out"
Eminem,"When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights, though, I'll be fine"
Eminem,"My bumper, they're scratchin' at the back of my trailer
Like I'm itchin' to get hitched, yeah, I'm rich as a bitch"
Eminem,"From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may"
Eminem,"Went from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch
To tiny drops, little drips"
Eminem,"That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
Every time we see a devil's face"
Eminem,"These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words"
Eminem,"While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence"
Eminem,"'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman"
Eminem,"""I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, the song ain't gon' write itself"
Eminem,"But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me"
Eminem,"He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind"
Eminem,"But they came to me just now—so I put 'em in a verse to lay
And I thank you (Uh), ‘cause you made me (Uh)"
Eminem,"Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
And you woulda bought it"
Eminem,"Or be “capped in America” like Steve Rogers
'Cause no one oversees these cops and"
Eminem,"But I'ma still be humble when I scream ""Fuck you!""
‘Cause I'm stronger than I was"
Eminem,"'Cause every time you do it's like an overload of fibs
I ain't sayin' this shit again, ho, you know what it is"
Eminem,"Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?"
Eminem,"New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, ooh-hoo"
Eminem,"That's how I had a whole planet that roots for me
As in the group, and no one thinks dark as I think (Nah)"
Eminem,"So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners"
Eminem,"New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, ooh-hoo"
Eminem,"Second base, what the fuck you tell Nick, Pumpkin?
The second week we were dry humpin', that's gotta count for somethin'"
Eminem,"The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow and ""Thank you all for comin' out"""
Eminem,"No, we can't get along 'til these white motherfuckin' cops
Who keep murderin' Blacks are off the streets (Off the streets)"
Eminem,"I don't smoke, but I got paper, to be blunt, I'm rolling in dough
And I keep it one comma zero, zero, zero, zero"
Eminem,"Black people saved my life, from the Doc and Deshaun
And all that we want is racial equality"
Eminem,"At times, juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess"
Eminem,"It goes: Reggie, JAY-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me"
Eminem,"I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I"
Eminem,"Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady"
Eminem,"At all, so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal"
Eminem,"But only when it freezes
It's the curse of the standard, that the first of the Mathers disc set"
Eminem,"Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again"
Eminem,"'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all"
Eminem,"And I ain't leavin' without you, bitch!
Comin' home with me!"
Eminem,"So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy"
Eminem,"When me and Luis were tryin' to stick two CDs in the same slot
Slim Shady, artful dodger"
Eminem,"You're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
(New-hoo, ooh-hoo) Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!"
Eminem,"Singin' fuck all of you in Autotune
I am too volatile and too grizzly to bear"
Eminem,"Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze"
Eminem,"To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing"
Eminem,"Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman
I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too"
Eminem,"And I'm so lost without you, without you
Without you"
Eminem,"Smoke so much weed, you wouldn't believe
And I get mo' ass than a toilet seat"
Eminem,"Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian"
Eminem,"I'm poppin' an extra clip, then cock and shoot, then I'm popping
Do not let me catch you slippin'"
Eminem,"I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
Oh boy, you drive me crazy, bitch, you make me hurl"
Eminem,"But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it 'cause you never know when it"
Eminem,"How to stand on their own, and I don't wanna open up wounds
I just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth"
Eminem,"""Okay, yeah, and I'm coo-coo, eh?"" — Well, screw you
And I'll be the third person who screwed you today"
Eminem,"Sing with me (Sing), sing for the year (Sing it)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on)"
Eminem,"And in the car, they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was, it was you"
Eminem,"And I feel like this is what got us in the debacle we're in
Been with you guys thick and thin"
Eminem,"This shit is like Romper Room
Why do I feel responsible for these kids?"
Eminem,"Jesus Christ, man, how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)"
Eminem,"(I love you) I love you, too
Let me whisper sweet nothings into your ear, boo"
Eminem,"Sets you off 'til you scream, ""Piss off! Screw you!""
When it talks to you like you don't belong"
Eminem,"I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two"
Eminem,"But a fighter's all I knew how to be
I got the shit beat out of me (Yeah)"
Eminem,"With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content"
Eminem,"Man, I just get high, let my hoes lay low (Ooh)
I just want some face but this is no facial (Ooh)"
Eminem,"I be on my own, head up in the clouds like Zeus
When they say, ""You ain't the GOAT"", I come down like, ""Who?"""
Eminem,"But I hate to pay a bill (Hate that)
And I made a mil' without a major deal (I made that)"
Eminem,"Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind"
Eminem,"White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get! (Yo)"
Eminem,"I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me)
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart"
Eminem,"And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on"
Eminem,"And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you
Two-hundred-fifty-thousand miles on a clear night in June"
Eminem,"Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time"
Eminem,"So imagine the havoc these black thoughts are to wreak (Tariq)
As in Trotter, I keep slaughterin' beats"
Eminem,"Sayin' that your new one isn't better than your last and
Even if it is, once they start to turn their backs"
Eminem,"Got me this far, picture me quittin'
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut"
Eminem,"Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor"
Eminem,"'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown"
Eminem,"(Ha) I don't know, that's just the way I am
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered"
Eminem,"... Read More
These ideas are nightmares to white parents"
Eminem,"'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth"
Eminem,"I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl"
Eminem,"Eight niggas, eight hittas, take eight souls (Brrr)
Collect pesos (Huh), and I'm paid, so? (Paid)"
Eminem,"Tonight, I want a slut, would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine"
Eminem,"That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep"
Eminem,"As long as that song's gettin' airplay, I'm dissin' you
I'm a hair away from gettin' carried away and gettin' sued"
Eminem,"As in Trotter, I keep slaughterin' beats
Shout out to Beatminerz and T-Minus"
Eminem,"Probably comin' from the dope house
We could let you slide but your tail light is blew, out"
Eminem,"'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death
So I've been givin' the media fingers"
Eminem,"Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make"
Eminem,"You could give your whole damn life to the music thing
They gon' turn around like they don't love you"
Eminem,"Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat"
Eminem,"But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause—
I walk on water"
Eminem,"Pull up on the side of you
Window rolled down, 'profile'"
Eminem,"And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is"
Eminem,"I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'"
Eminem,"Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble"
Eminem,"Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman"
Eminem,"It's real easy, just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by"
Eminem,"So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me"
Eminem,"White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, Little Eric looks just like this"
Eminem,"You're a supernova and I'm a
I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon"
Eminem,"It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy"
Eminem,"Now, this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me"
Eminem,"We're applying, but McDonald's
Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire"
Eminem,"Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase"
Eminem,"Shake that ass for me, ah, girl
Shake that ass for me"
Eminem,"And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences"
Eminem,"I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman"
Eminem,"Out of a hundred million who are goin' through a
Struggle feels it and relates, that's great"
Eminem,"Swear I can see the game from a bird's-eye view, ayy
Bitch, you talkin' to a rap god, ayy"
Eminem,"My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead"
Eminem,"So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a—parasite"
Eminem,"So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne"
Eminem,"I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you"
Eminem,"And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, ""Baby, please don't leave!"""
Eminem,"Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see"
Eminem,"Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady"
Eminem,"It's the curse of the standard, that the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven’t spit yet"
Eminem,"And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall"
Eminem,"You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail"
Eminem,"If only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense"
Eminem,"Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you, you will"
Eminem,"I’m sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y’all are"
Eminem,"But my respect is overdue, I'm showin' you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit"
Eminem,"And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy"
Eminem,"And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be out of your mind and out of control"
Eminem,"Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die"
Eminem,"Every time we see a devil's face
Lions, tigers, and bears, oh my"
Eminem,"We're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine
Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities"
Eminem,"Flippin' the you-know-who"", ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose"
Eminem,"And I'm not Prince, so...
I walk on water"
Eminem,"Surely hip-hop was never a problem in Harlem, only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin' to blossom"
Eminem,"Pray you see tomorrow, little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn"
Eminem,"I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles"
Eminem,"Hit Europe, kicked the door in, put a foot through it (Ugh)
Like a stirrup (Stirrup)"
Eminem,"""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!"""
Eminem,"So how can we have higher standards?
As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter"
Eminem,"Fuck is my head in the clouds (Nah)
G5 with the stewardess, gettin' head in the clouds (Haha)"
Eminem,"Ayy, ayy
They wanna bleed me and lead me to act like they need me, but fuck it, I do it alone (Woah)"
Eminem,"Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm"
Eminem,"Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you"
Eminem,"I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey"
Eminem,"This it for me, give my daughters a kiss for me
Y'all call this fame, I call this shit alcoholistic infamy"

Shit make me wanna make a hunnid more"
Eminem,"I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There prob'ly was a problem at the post office or somethin'"
Eminem,"That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too because I looked like them"
Eminem,"I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved"
Eminem,"'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out ('Til the roof, until the roof)
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth (The roof comes off, the roof comes off)"
Eminem,"See, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7"
Eminem,"Whose moms probably would've never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence"
Eminem,"Where I planted my roots (What? Yeah)
That's how I had a whole planet that roots for me"
Eminem,"So all that love shit is null and void, bitch, I'm a droid
I avoid Cupid, stupid! Wasn't for blow jobs, you'd be unemployed"
Eminem,"I'm in cake mode (Huh), I'm in brave mode, uh
What up, Marshall? I'm a martian, I'm in Wayne mode (Facts)"

Eminem,"Got several bounties from feds in every county
I'm with a gal at a Checkers wiling"
Eminem,"I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God

Eminem,"You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out"
Eminem,"I'm watching my pupils get cornier (Uh)
But I'm contemplating yelling ""Bombs away"" on the game"
Eminem,"Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo"
Eminem,"I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed (Get along with)"
Eminem,"I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world (Ooh-ooh)
Oh boy, you drive me crazy, bitch, you make me hurl"
Eminem,"New-hoo, ooh-hoo

Eminem,"But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old"
Eminem,"And you've had enough of me
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge"
Eminem,"Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep"
Eminem,"And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook"
Eminem,"New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, ooh-hoo"
Eminem,"Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'"

And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy"
Eminem,"Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'"

And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough"
Eminem,"Tobey Maguire got bit by a spider, but see, me, it was a goat
If you want space, I hope you take your helmet off soon as you get up to Venus and choke"

When you're bit with the—"
Eminem,"Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously"
Eminem,"Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep"
Eminem,"While the demons comin' out of me
Wifey's on the side of me talkin' sense into me"
Eminem,"In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
Do not come and speak to me"
Eminem,"""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss"
Eminem,"I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man"
Eminem,"Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms"
Eminem,"Am I too nice? Buy you ice?
Bitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life"
Eminem,"With a fuckin' knife in the gut while I'm wipin' my butt
'Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut"

She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it"
Eminem,"As K-Solo had asked, will the   “Real Solo Please Stand Up” in 1990... Read More

Eminem,"And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered"
Eminem,"Two trailer-park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside"

Tobey Maguire got bit by a spider, but see, me, it was a goat"
Eminem,"You're tryin' to save me
Stop holdin' your breath"
Eminem,"I been knocked down so many times, can't count (Ugh)
Sometimes, shit does not pan out"
Eminem,"Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:
Conversation and Hennessy"
Eminem,"Like a web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap"
Eminem,"I be on my own (Yeah, woo), head up in the clouds like Zeus
When they say, ""You ain't the GOAT"", I come down like, ""Who?"""

Eminem,"Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick"
Eminem,"But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me"
Eminem,"That had its Natives killed
Got you singin' this star-spangled spiel"
Eminem,"Who was one of the reasons why I am here
They tell me I should just let that shit go and slide (Why?)"
Eminem,"And said I was gross, go get a towel, your stomach's curling
Or maybe you do"
Eminem,"(Yo, left, right, left) And get that motivation to not give up
(Yo, left, yo, left) And not be a quitter"
Eminem,"If I ain't got a weapon, I'ma pick up a rock

Where I planted my roots (What? Yeah)"
Eminem,"And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice"
Eminem,"And you woulda bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it"
Eminem,"They ain't never comin' back in
They did it to Chance"
Eminem,"We know you're hidin' that Heidi Klum
On you another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you"

I'd rather die than you not by my side"
Eminem,"And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead?"
Eminem,"What you gonna say, I'm lucky? Tell the public that I was so ugly
That you fuckin' had to be drunk to fuck me?"
Eminem,"Two-hundred-fifty-thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you"
Eminem,"I ain't here to save the fuckin' children, but if one kid
Out of a hundred million who are goin' through a"
Eminem,"I'm a shit-stirrer, you're a dime-a
Dozen, said I couldn't do it"

""Fuck it,"" until I met Dre, the only one to look past"
Eminem,"I got the shit beat out of me (Yeah)
Tripped and fell and blew out a knee (Pop)"
Eminem,"Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adiós"
Eminem,"Window rolled down, 'profile'
Then we wonder why we see this side of you"
Eminem,"To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace"
Eminem,"So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die

Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'"
Eminem,"The block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot
Call the attack dogs off of us, man"
Eminem,"I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends"
Eminem,"It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed"
Eminem,"And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em
A subconscious racist"
Eminem,"I get on a beat and it's like that ""Eye of the Tiger"" song is playin' on my head on repeat
I been knocked down so many times, can't count (Ugh)"

I can't listen to you for a whole minute"
Eminem,"End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones"
Eminem,"I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage"
Eminem,"Sincerely yours, Stan, PS: We should be together too
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I"
Eminem,"Please stay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees"
Eminem,"All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn"
Eminem,"You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
And bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop"
Eminem,"Oh no, got your pants caught on the fence post
Getting chased, by them Jackboys, think it's 'bout to fuzz"
Eminem,"Top 5 in this muh'fucka, and if I don't make the cut
What? Like I give a fuck, I'ma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck"
Eminem,"When I'm constantly passin' the buck like the fuckin' Dollar Tree
But I'ma always remind you that I came from poverty"
Eminem,"But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"""
Eminem,"But they've been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press"
Eminem,"Black eyes on the movement
Which makes black lives madder"
Eminem,"I'm single now: got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down"
Eminem,"I said this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me"
Eminem,"Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols"
Eminem,"Testing, ""Attention, please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me"
Eminem,"As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because—"
Eminem,"Oh, shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?!
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I"
Eminem,"Cut the fuckin' act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again
With another anthem – why stop when it doesn't have to end?"
Eminem,"And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing"
Eminem,"First time since you left
And left me with nothin' but shattered dreams"
Eminem,"(Mary P; Slim Shady) Comin' at you
So if you'll still be my (Baby girl)"
Eminem,"Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's gonna be that one?
And then once we get 'em, it's never the same"
Eminem,"I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it"
Eminem,"Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing"
Eminem,"Nah, not really (Haha)
I had ""dog"" backwards"
Eminem,"That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me"
Eminem,"It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?"
Eminem,"Then we wonder why we see this side of you
Probably comin' from the dope house"
Eminem,"I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating"
Eminem,"""But you kill each other, facts
You peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats”"
Eminem,"And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think"
Eminem,"White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get"
Eminem,"And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you asked for me?"
Eminem,"And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest (Illa, Illa, Illa)"
Eminem,"'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman"
Eminem,"Is refresh your memory when you said (I want you)
Now should I keep goin' or should we call truce?"
Eminem,"They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)"
Eminem,"'Cause if I get burnt, I'ma show you what it's like to hurt
'Cause I been treated like dirt before ya"
Eminem,"Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock"
Eminem,"Was probably his in exchange for every White fan that he's got
Like damn, we just swapped, sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow"
Eminem,"The song ""Guilty Conscience"" has gotten such rotten responses""
And all of this controversy circles me"
Eminem,"Yonder and stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist"
Eminem,"As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in
To the sixties, having black skin is risky"
Eminem,"So if you'll still be my (Baby girl)
Then I'll still be your (Superhero)"
Eminem,"When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating (Hey)
You waited this long, now stop debating"
Eminem,"It ain't even worth dissing someone so offbeat
That they can't even figure out where their words"
Eminem,"But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was"
Eminem,"Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar
Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and"
Eminem,"I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out ('Til the roof, until the roof)"
Eminem,"I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver? You said if I'd write you, you would write back"
Eminem,"And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey"
Eminem,"And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too"
Eminem,"Punchliner just tryin' to survive in this climate of vaginas (Bitch)
Who dyin' to cancel my ass like Aunt Jemima syrup"
Eminem,"What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow"
Eminem,"Life is a gamble and I'm playin' slots, pull it down, close my eyes and I pray I win tokens
All Wock', no pop, how we drop, you can come and take a baby sip, still taste that it's potent"
Eminem,"As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn"
Eminem,"And don't squander it 'cause you never know when it
All could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'"
Eminem,"I think I love you, baby, I think I love you too
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world"
Eminem,"So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track"
Eminem,"Two-hundred-fifty-thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you, without you"
Eminem,"All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently"
Eminem,"And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this
And I woulda done anything for you"
Eminem,"Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me"
Eminem,"I've been to the motherfuckin' mountaintop
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop"
Eminem,"And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy"
Eminem,"“So Much Better” seems to be some kind of throwback song to 2004’s “Puke,” featuring a similar... Read More
You fuckin' groupie"
Eminem,"I'm just playin', bitch
You know I love you"
Eminem,"Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on"
Eminem,"Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day"
Eminem,"New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, ooh-hoo"
Eminem,"If you dropped dead? (Bitch)
I would feel so much, much better"
Eminem,"Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
I don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit"
Eminem,"I am too volatile and too grizzly to bear
Yeah, shit is gettin' to where I can barely even sit in a chair"
Eminem,"Maybe tomorrow, the good lord will take you away
They say music can alter moods and talk to you"
Eminem,"Get the plunger (Plunger), 'cause Marshall and M.A go plum crazy
Call us liquid plumber, 'cause even Dre know (Dre know)"
Eminem,"Tears stream down both of my cheeks, now I let you go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this"
Eminem,"I know what you wanna hear
I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too"
Eminem,"So me and you are not alike
Bitch, I wrote ""Stan"""
Eminem,"But I ain't no Jesus
(It's the curse of the—, it's the curse of the—)"
Eminem,"I'm shot in the lungs, I gasp, I can't breathe
Just lay here with me, baby, hold me please"
Eminem,"They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?"
Eminem,"I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great (Ugh)
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate"
Eminem,"This is not how I planned for our story to end
I love all of you men"
Eminem,"Bitch, that was a lie
Now I never"
Eminem,"Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman
'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman"
Eminem,"I love conflict, got a obnoxious (What?) subconscious (Yeah)
I'm afraid to unlock it (Nah)"
Eminem,"Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating"
Eminem,"White Cartiers, all I'm seein' is dope
My city Leia and I'm Obi-Wan, got a mission to pass, I just might be the hope"

I'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon"

But I'm movin' on with mine, Nick, is that  your (Wife)"
Eminem,"Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back"
Eminem,"Niggas ain't turnin' me down, when my baby asleep only time that I'm watchin' my tone, look (Shh)
We don't want chips with a chip on our shoulder"
Eminem,"But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
If you try to slander the flag but"
Eminem,"While the politicians that are white and privileged ask how is this different from segregation, that's funny bro
Segregation is bein' told where I'm gonna go"
Eminem,"Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday"
Eminem,"Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth, it's all I know how to do
As soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit"
Eminem,"I was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
And then this thought just popped in my head"
Eminem,"You always say that, you always say, 'This is the last time'
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine"""
Eminem,"But I'ma still be humble when I scream ""Fuck you!""
‘Cause I'm stronger than I was"
Eminem,"MCs, blood gets spilled then I'll
Take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track"
Eminem,"If I could leave this all behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line"
Eminem,"They call me Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately"
Eminem,"Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'"
Eminem,"You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me—"
Eminem,"But I'ma still be humble when I scream ""Fuck you!""
‘Cause I'm stronger than I was"
Eminem,"I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit
Two to the one, from the one to the three"
Eminem,"Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots"
Eminem,"The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew
How to stand on their own, and I don't wanna open up wounds"
Eminem,"But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out"
Eminem,"I like good pussy and I like good tree
Smoke so much weed, you wouldn't believe"
Eminem,"So I've been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh"
Eminem,"To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict"
Eminem,"I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends"
Eminem,"But fuck it, there’s other fish in the sea
And I'ma have a whale of a time"
Eminem,"It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm goin', when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting"
Eminem,"Done all we possibly can, I know we kept our hopes up
But the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live"
Eminem,"Long as I got a bat and two balls it's foul, but my dick's on strike
So all that love shit is null and void, bitch, I'm a droid"
Eminem,"Yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin'"
Eminem,"When you're bit with the—
Venom, adrenaline momentum"
Eminem,"It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (Ooouuu)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that"
Eminem,"Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect"
Eminem,"All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy
Sponsors workin' 'round the clock to try to stop my concerts early"
Eminem,"Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll
Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield"
Eminem,"They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)"
Eminem,"This is it—it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this"
Eminem,"And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me"
Eminem,"Aimed at little Erica to attack her character
The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns"
Eminem,"Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache"
Eminem,"That's just the way that the card hand's dealt
John Manziel, odd man out (What?)"
Eminem,"'Cause I met your bitch on the internet now I'm getting head like a Pillow Pet
That bimbo can put her lips all the way around this bone and then blow"
Eminem,"Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever, so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these motherfuckin' hoes"
Eminem,"Oh boy, you drive me crazy, bitch, you make me hurl
They call me Superman"
Eminem,"I feel the ice cracking, because—
I walk on water"
Eminem,"Regardless, it was wrong of me, but
I be on my own (Yeah), head up in the clouds like Zeus"
Eminem,"When they say, ""You ain't the GOAT"", I come down like, ""Who?""
But I got my head in the clouds like Zeus"
Eminem,"But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex-
pectations and meet 'em, but first"
Eminem,"Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin', I'm tryna stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen, so fuck it, I'm tryna stop you from breathin'"
Eminem,"Can't take 'way from me, you just need to take cover (Frr)
I can paint a picture like I made the stencil"
Eminem,"Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently
Off of this chest, and I rest again peacefully"
Eminem,"I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus"
Eminem,"Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho"
Eminem,"Shake it, shake it, break it, break it, uh
Nigga, we made it, made it, they hate it, hate it"
Eminem,"Bite me, bitch, chew on a nineteen footer!
‘Cause this morning I finally stood up"
Eminem,"The morning rain clouds up my window (Window)
And I can't see at all"
Eminem,"Please, dog, I need y'all to keep talking shit 'cause I feed off of it
I am the complete opposite of these retards who spit these weak bars, I'ma leave carnage"
Eminem,"You walked out, I almost died
It was almost a homicide"
Eminem,"But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first"
Eminem,"""Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!""
""But, baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?"""
Eminem,"But you're never gonna beat me to the fuckin' punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ"
Eminem,"Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm"
Eminem,"White Cartiers, all I'm seein' is dope (Yeah)
My city Leia and I'm Obi-Wan, got a mission to pass, I just might be the hope"
Eminem,"Little boy, you're never gonna get no rope chain
Get your shit stole, and your lip swole, I became bitter"
Eminem,"So bad in my fuckin' life
But fuck it, there’s other fish in the sea"
Eminem,"Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm"
Eminem,"I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo"
Eminem,"In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie"
Eminem,"Knock knock, let the devil in
Manevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'"
Eminem,"Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me"
Eminem,"If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am"
Eminem,"Shit, bro, hold up, wait
I just tripped over my cape (Superman)"
Eminem,"Some girls, they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it"
Eminem,"But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service"
Eminem,"Like damn, we just swapped, sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow
I'm like my skin is it startin' to work to my benefit now? It's—"
Eminem,"And they wanna get one 'cause they think this shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves"
Eminem,"And I don't know how to recapture that time and that era
I've tried hearkening back to, but I'm fightin' for air"
Eminem,"So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish"
Eminem,"(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
I said knock knock, let the devil in"
Eminem,"For you to go get what you desire most (Yeah)
Spit fire, bitch, I was just flyin' coach (Yeah)"
Eminem,"And his girl
Haha, Nate Dogg!"
Eminem,"Kick back while I kick facts, yeah, Dre—sick track
Perfect way to get back, wanna hear something wick-wack?"
Eminem,"Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top, every fan Black that I got"
Eminem,"I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumpin' it on
White America, I could be one of your kids"
Eminem,"flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with"
Eminem,"You peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats”
Single mother strugglin' through substance abuse"
Eminem,"I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones
It was never the same, and it's bothered me since"
Eminem,"No one's ever indicted you
Why? 'Cause you're a..."
Eminem,"Pray you see tomorrow, little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn"
Eminem,"Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me"
Eminem,"I don't see what the big deal is anyway
You're just plain old Marshall to me"""
Eminem,"Alien, E-E-Elliott phone home
Ain't no telling when this chokehold"
Eminem,"Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards"
Eminem,"You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney—Nate, hit me!"
Eminem,"Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself
If they were brown, Shady'd lose, Shady sits on the shelf"
Eminem,"The morning rain clouds up my window (Window)
And I can't see at all"
Eminem,"Leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy, whoadie"
Eminem,"Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it"
Eminem,"And just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true
Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it"
Eminem,"Please stand up, please stand up?
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)"
Eminem,"Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win? Wouldn't it be weird?"""
Eminem,"Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home"
Eminem,"Fuck it, just shut up and listen
Ayo"
Eminem,"I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back"
Eminem,"While people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes
Fuck your Republican views"
Eminem,"I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship; save it, bitch!"
Eminem,"And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall"
Eminem,"But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me"
Eminem,"I said, ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists""
But my beef is more media journalists"
Eminem,"Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole"
Eminem,"I say, every day she be givin' it up
(Now) Shake that ass for me"
Eminem,"I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Down to the river with you"
Eminem,"For turnin' your fuckin' back on Bizzy, Kuniva, and Swift?
A Freudian slip, subconsciously, I honestly wished"
Eminem,"Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman"
Eminem,"Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
Now, I hope you don't get mad at me"
Eminem,"I'm still angry, yeah, I may be
I may never trust someone"
Eminem,"Let's cut to the chase 'fore the door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open"
Eminem,"Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho"
Eminem,"The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling"
Eminem,"The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde"
Eminem,"So don't lump me in with them chump-ions
I'm done bein' your punching bag"
Eminem,"And I get mo' ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one, from the one to the three"
Eminem,"The second week we were dry humpin', that's gotta count for somethin'
Listen, girly, surely you don't want me to talk about how I nutted early"
Eminem,"Into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie, hold them bitches straighter up"
Eminem,"So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?"
Eminem,"It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I"
Eminem,"They wanna JonBenét me (Fuck you), I'm unaccommodating
Man, I don't see why they hate me (Huh?)"
Eminem,"Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' butt
Some girls, they act retarded (Man, I told you–)"
Eminem,"I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting"
Eminem,"Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters"
Eminem,"But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father"
Eminem,"'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating"
Eminem,"But bitches ain't shit, I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
Bitch, you complain when you listen to this"
Eminem,"And go into a cardiac arrest, my life'd be so much better if you just—
My life would be so much better"
Eminem,"Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy"
Eminem,"""You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?""
""Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more"" ""Daddy, you're lyin'"
Eminem,"Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?"
Eminem,"This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all"
Eminem,"Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts, and see where this takes me, ’cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now
Yeah"
Eminem,"So we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings
Just keep marchin', 'til we reach congress"
Eminem,"Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley"
Eminem,"There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge"
Eminem,"Hum, dei-dei, la-la
La-la, la-la-la"
Eminem,"I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em"
Eminem,"You start thinkin' of all the artists you dissed
All the carnage you left, is this the kind of karma you get"
Eminem,"Catches, ho, I got an Oscar attached to my fuckin' name (De La)
I might hit the club, find a chick that's tailor-made"
Eminem,"I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream ""Fuck you!"""
Eminem,"And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice"
Eminem,"Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in and up under your skin like a splinter"
Eminem,"White Cartiers, all I'm seein' is dope
My city Leia and I'm Obi-Wan, got a mission to pass, I just might be the hope"
Eminem,"But I just can't be the guy everybody depends
On for entire careers 'cause that's not even fair"
Eminem,"Enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter"
Eminem,"I felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?"
Eminem,"They play with my name and I can't take it (Lil' bitch)
Tobey Maguire got bit by a spider, but see, me, it was a goat"
Eminem,"A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex-"
Eminem,"If you want space, I hope you take your helmet off soon as you get up to Venus and choke
Even while sleepin', be thinkin' so woke"
Eminem,"And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady"
Eminem,"I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
'Cause Congress keep tellin' me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems"
Eminem,"(Now) Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, come on, girl"
Eminem,"And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn"
Eminem,"Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problemed child, and what bothers him all comes out"
Eminem,"In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick"
Eminem,"Should hit the kick and the snare
Pray you see tomorrow, little boy, you gon' learn"
Eminem,"Make a bigot racist uncomfortable
If y'all against talk and reparation then I'm not against the thought of separation"
Eminem,"It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be like tryin' to start over
I got a hole in my heart, but some kind of emotional roller coaster"
Eminem,"And know nobody black so they act afraid of us
And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em"
Eminem,"Tryin' not to adopt my father's old philosophies
Same time I'm prayin' to God that everything works out at his colonoscopy"
Eminem,"Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I"
Eminem,"My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin"
Eminem,"Pro professional, pure persistent, I'm paper chasing
I hate complaining, I hated waiting, I'll pay for patience"
Eminem,"I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired that I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables"
Eminem,"Thought my name was B-side 'cause they flipped over my tape
And I won't hesitate"
Eminem,"As soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showin' you the flow no one do"
Eminem,"Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine, or you think water is pink"
Eminem,"So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)"
Eminem,"But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go"
Eminem,"Only this gun, lonely, 'cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Uh-huh)"
Eminem,"'Cause it latched on to you, like—
Knock knock, let the devil in"
Eminem,"Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbly, we finna, finna have a"
Eminem,"When the world gives you a raw deal
Sets you off 'til you scream, ""Piss off! Screw you!"""
Eminem,"That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly"
Eminem,"Excuse the pun, but bitch is such a broad statement, and I'm
Channelin' my anger through every single station that's on!"
Eminem,"Took a blood test, ain't no ho in it
Watch your motherfuckin' mouth 'fore I go in it"
Eminem,"(Now) Look at this lady all in front of me
Sexy as can be"
Eminem,"Because they're gonna taste my—
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum"
Eminem,"It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over
I'ma wash away my sins"
Eminem,"We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt)"
Eminem,"Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em"
Eminem,"""But, baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?""
""I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'"
Eminem,"Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems"
Eminem,"Daddy's writin' a song, the song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself"""
Eminem,"Boy, huh
Tobey Maguire got bit by a spider, but see, me, it was a goat"
Eminem,"Oh, fourth—Dre, Drake, Lupe—ooh, touché
You were too two-faced for me"
Eminem,"Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good lord will take you away"
Eminem,"Well, that's nothin'
New-hoo, ooh-hoo"
Eminem,"I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends, it was 'bout"
Eminem,"And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to"
Eminem,"God
And I ain't leavin' without you, bitch!"
Eminem,"I'm moving on but you know your scruples are gone when you're born with Lucifer's horns
And you're from the school of Notorious, Puba, Cube and The Poor Righteous Teachers tutored my students"
Eminem,"'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me"
Eminem,"Girl, you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans"
Eminem,"Though I ain't left no one behind, but we been down every road
Done all we possibly can, I know we kept our hopes up"
Eminem,"I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating"

But I ain't talkin' drip when I say that I'll get the drop on you"

While the demons comin' out of me"

She's all 99 of 'em, I need a machine gun"
Eminem,"Dre, just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit"
Eminem,"Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit"
Eminem,"They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me"
Eminem,"My skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be"
Eminem,"I'm tired of all you
I don't mean to be mean"
Eminem,"He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm"
Eminem,"His thoughts are wacked, he's mad, so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap"
Eminem,"I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to"
Eminem,"Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough"
Eminem,"""I'm not fazed, I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyway"
Eminem,"I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin' 'cause, man, I can hear 'em"
Eminem,"I'm a God to you, y'all better worship the water I walk on
Or y'all gonna meet your Waterloo"
Eminem,"For the freedom of speech the United States government has sworn to uphold... or so we're told
(Yo, I want everybody to listen to the words of this song)"
Eminem,"There's no control, he just lets his emotions go
(Come on) Sing with me (Sing), sing for the year (Sing it)"
Eminem,"Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?"
Eminem,"I'm lookin' fo' a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say, every day she be givin' it up"
Eminem,"But you're all that I love, I grasp, you can't leave
Please stay here with me, baby, hold me please"
Eminem,"But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water"
Eminem,"It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it wit' ya""
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror"
Eminem,"Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'"
Eminem,"'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster"
Eminem,"If she don't (Stick to the script) then I'ma just keep goin'
Damn"
Eminem,"Bitch, you lost me (Yeah)
Fair weather, wishy-washy"
Eminem,"Now the cops wanna set up roadblocks on my head, I
Got several bounties from feds in every county"

Make a bigot racist uncomfortable"

On this game will end, I'm loco"
Eminem,"Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo"
Eminem,"Ha ha ha, I'm just playin', America
You know I love you"
Eminem,"Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here"
Eminem,"She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose"
Eminem,"These bitches tryin' to get attached, but they're failin' to latch onto the tail of
My bumper, they're scratchin' at the back of my trailer"
Eminem,"The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney—Nate, hit me!
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out"
Eminem,"'Cause you just did the impossible, gained my trust
Don't play games, it'll be dangerous if you fuck me over"
Eminem,"In the tradition of most of Eminem’s follow-up singles, “The Way I Am” features a much darker and... Read More
Man, whatever"
Eminem,"I said this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me"
Eminem,"From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass"
Eminem,"You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some"
Eminem,"Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass"
Eminem,"She's all 99 of 'em, I need a machine gun
I'll take 'em all out, I hope you hear this song"

I've had a great view to see the (See the) game through (Through)"
Eminem,"Shake that ass for me, come on, girl
Shake that ass for me"
Eminem,"Now, this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me"
Eminem,"A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker"
Eminem,"Dre'll tell you how I shred
So when you refer to the guy next to the doc, you meant shredder"
Eminem,"I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge"
Eminem,"I don't know what the fuck they done told niggas
I put all of my heart and my soul in it"
Eminem,"To hit 'em with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced"
Eminem,"Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day"
Eminem,"And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice"
Eminem,"Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free"
Eminem,"I was dehydrated 'til the beat vibrated
I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated"
Eminem,"We were globally huge, watchin' sales go through the roof
We wrote and we feuded, Runyon Avenue soldiers included"
Eminem,"To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (Brrr!)"
Eminem,"My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y’all are
To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion of you"
Eminem,"But when I do fall from these heights, though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine"
Eminem,"Comin' home with me!
And my boy, and his boy"
Eminem,"Bitch, I'm omnipresent, I got no reflection
Made a livin' off bars, I need no correction (No)"
Eminem,"Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn"
Eminem,"Kiss my dick, get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass"
Eminem,"Showed them all the blueprint and formula
But it seems like the more they studied my music, the more they remind me of eyeballs"
Eminem,"Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back"
Eminem,"And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady"
Eminem,"If he Obi-Wan, then I gotta be Yoda
Don't need no promoter, we pull up, they know us"
Eminem,"Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman
'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman"
Eminem,"Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can’t reach"
Eminem,"Pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and
Throw your ass in the van cuffed"
Eminem,"Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em"
Eminem,"Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question, though"
Eminem,"Help me leave this all behind
I'ma wash away my sins"
Eminem,"One minute you're bodyin' shit, but then your audience splits
You can already sense the climate is startin' to shift"
Eminem,"Through the side of a pump, zero to sixty, hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up"
Eminem,"Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night"""
Eminem,"It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it"
Eminem,"When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend"
Eminem,"White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, Little Eric looks just like this"
Eminem,"Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on)
Sing it with me, it's just for today"
Eminem,"Hands up, officer don't shoot
Then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot"
Eminem,"So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?"
Eminem,"Saturday through Sunday, Monday (Yeah-yeah)
Monday through Sunday, yo"
Eminem,"So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared"
Eminem,"Me for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow, I'm stabbin' myself
With a fuckin' knife in the gut while I'm wipin' my butt"
Eminem,"And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm"
Eminem,"But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up)"
Eminem,"Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, ah, girl"
Eminem,"It's a warning shot, 'fore I blow up your whole spot
Call my bluff and I'll release every fuckin' thing I got"
Eminem,"'Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me
So, pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers"
Eminem,"Or y'all gonna meet your Waterloo
I get to flippin' the mic' as a murder weapon"
Eminem,"You went there lookin' for me? Boo, that excuse is too lame
Keep playin' me, you're gonna end up with a huge goose egg"
Eminem,"When you was on my dick and give you something to smile about
How many times you fly to my house, still tryin' to count"
Eminem,"Forever
Bitch, that was a lie"
Eminem,"Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales"
Eminem,"All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up"
Eminem,"That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do"
Eminem,"Into ya, the back of it just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill"
Eminem,"Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House"
Eminem,"Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is"
Eminem,"But I'ma always remind you that I came from poverty
Black people saved my life, from the Doc and Deshaun"
Eminem,"A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves"
Eminem,"Like I'ma sit and fight with you over some slut bitch cunt
That made me put up with her psycho ass over six months"
Eminem,"You probably think 'cause it's been so long
If I had something on you I woulda did it by now"
Eminem,"But I pray you see tomorrow, little boy, you gon' learn
I'm a product of properly hoppin' up out of that poverty"
Eminem,"They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'"
Eminem,"I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:"
Eminem,"Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid"
Eminem,"There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on"
Eminem,"(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum"
Eminem,"Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do"
Eminem,"I was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
And then this thought just popped in my head (You made me like this way)"
Eminem,"'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam"
Eminem,"But, even to the untrained human eye
We ain't the same, you and I"
Eminem,"You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan, PS: We should be together too"
Eminem,"And only spread her legs to let me hit once, yeah
What you gonna say, I'm lucky? Tell the public that I was so ugly"
Eminem,"R.I.P. Laquan McDonald, Trayvon, and Breonna
Atatiana, Rayshard, and Dominique"
Eminem,"And I hit them pads like a boxing gym
Better watch for Slim, better get to popping and when I'm at the top again"
Eminem,"Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment"
Eminem,"I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—"
Eminem,"You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have"
Eminem,"I've been makin' my mistakes, oh, if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do"
Eminem,"Thought we was runnin' shit 'til we lost the sole of our shoe
The death of Doody broke us in two"
Eminem,"Or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black
You better be strapped with a derringer"
Eminem,"I take a bow and ""Thank you all for comin' out""
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd"
Eminem,"And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict"
Eminem,"And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach"
Eminem,"I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—"
Eminem,"But that's water under the bridge
But I'm washin' my sins in it 'til my conscience is cleansed"
Eminem,"And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on"
Eminem,"Freddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz
Why is it they treat us like dryer lint?"
Eminem,"You're just plain old Marshall to me""
Ooh, yeah, girl, run that game"
Eminem,"Me and Nate D-o-double-g
Lookin' for a couple bitches with some double D's"
Eminem,"That's under my bed
Get along with the voices"
Eminem,"I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too"
Eminem,"Feels like I'm on the descent, but it was not my intent
To treat y'all like a stepping stone"
Eminem,"I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze"
Eminem,"On this Earth, and since birth, I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works"
Eminem,"Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows"
Eminem,"Our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands
And put our minds more at ease"
Eminem,"Searchin' with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
Waitin' to choke, tightenin' around my throat"
Eminem,"White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get"
Eminem,"And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song ""Guilty Conscience"" has gotten such rotten responses"""
Eminem,"You won't ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the M-I-C"
Eminem,"""But Slim, what if you win? Wouldn't it be weird?""
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?"
Eminem,"We waited in the blisterin' cold for you, for four hours, and you just said, ""no""
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol"
Eminem,"Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit"
Eminem,"If you want space, I hope you take your helmet off soon as you get up to Venus and choke
Even while sleepin', be thinkin' so woke"
Eminem,"So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy"
Eminem,"I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back"
Eminem,"Yeah, you think I'm crazy
I'm friends with the monster"
Eminem,"'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman"
Eminem,"Oh boy, you drive me crazy, bitch, you make me hurl
First thing you say:"
Eminem,"No patience is in me, and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you ten feet in the air"
Eminem,"So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first"
Eminem,"Get along with the voices
Inside of my head (You're tryin' to)"
Eminem,"If I walked on water, I would drown
'Cause I'm just a man"
Eminem,"'Cause the truth is, the moment that Proof died, so did the group
Shoot"
Eminem,"I think I love you, baby, I think I love you too (Oh-ooh)
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world (Ooh-ooh, ooh)"
Eminem,"Like a stirrup (Stirrup)
Used to have to sit and watch them bills pile up (Yeah)"
Eminem,"I walk on water (Shit)
But only when it freezes"
Eminem,"But, me, long as I breathe, promise to be honest
And wholeheartedly, apologies, Rihanna"
Eminem,"(Ha) I don't know, that's just the way I am
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired that I wish that I would just die or get fired"
Eminem,"White Cartiers, all I'm seein' is dope
My city Leia and I'm Obi-Wan, got a mission to pass, I just might be the hope"
Eminem,"Why do I feel responsible for these kids?
All of whom I'm a father to"
Eminem,"'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me"
Eminem,"It's the broke lingo (Huh)
And no, ain't nothing Saweetie, this is no Quavo (Migo)"
Eminem,"I see Mary Ann, Mary Ann's saying cut the tape
Cut the tape, knife"
Eminem,"I got the same exact tat that's on Nick's back
I'm obsessed now, oh gee"
Eminem,"They start feelin' like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch"""
Eminem,"Tobey Maguire got bit by a spider, but see, me, it was a goat
If you want space, I hope you take your helmet off soon as you get up to Venus and choke"
Eminem,"Fuck all the drugs you take, I'm takin' over
I paid attention, don't need no payola"
Eminem,"Disrespect that life and I'm in gang mode (Grrr)
You can leave this earth, bitch, I'm in rake mode (Huh)"
Eminem,"Didn't have knots, I was so broke
On my last rock, for my slingshot"
Eminem,"In this song, Eminem disses Mariah Carey and her husband Nick Cannon, telling us some... Read More
Only reason I dissed you in the first place"
Eminem,"But that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financially
And can't find answers"
Eminem,"Is 'cause you denied seeing me, now I'm pissed off
Sit back, homie, relax, in fact, grab a six pack"
Eminem,"'Til the day that I drop, you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em"
Eminem,"Swear to God, man, her favorite rapper wish he'd cross me (Yeah)
I love conflict, got a obnoxious (What?) subconscious (Yeah)"
Eminem,"'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him"
Eminem,"But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink"
Eminem,"I think I'm losin' control
God"
Eminem,"What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two"
Eminem,"And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man, will I survive in this climate or what?"
Eminem,"You're snake-bitten with my—venom
With the ballpoint pen I'm"
Eminem,"That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringing, there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'"
Eminem,"I tell a muhfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names"
Eminem,"A tisket, a tasket, I'll go tit-for-tat wit'
Anybody who's talkin', ""This shit, that shit"""
Eminem,"'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps"
Eminem,"But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind"
Eminem,"I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you (Bitch)"
Eminem,"Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic"
Eminem,"Yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin'"
Eminem,"Get along with the voices
Inside of my head"
Eminem,"Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut"
Eminem,"Even while sleepin', be thinkin' so woke
White Cartiers, all I'm seein' is dope"
Eminem,"Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am"
Eminem,"Way beyond crazy, Shady gone, but hey, maybe I'm the goat
That bit Sean and BabyTron, and that's why they be on the shit they be on 'cause"
Eminem,"What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say"
Eminem,"I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Down to the river with you"
Eminem,"'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps ('Til my legs, until my legs)
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me)"
Eminem,"There prob'ly was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em"
Eminem,"That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby, ha"
Eminem,"My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does"
Eminem,"All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up"
Eminem,"And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times"
Eminem,"Now it's so sad to see
An upper-class city havin' this happenin'"
Eminem,"Inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me"
Eminem,"'Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut"
Eminem,"You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us"
Eminem,"'Cause this keeps happening
Throughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shit"
Eminem,"'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney"
Eminem,"Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back"
Eminem,"Watchin' me while I write this, like, ""I don't like this note!""
All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy"
Eminem,"Uh-huh
I know what you wanna hear"
Eminem,"You fuckin' groupie
Pick up the goddamn phone"
Eminem,"Take a little bit of this fluoride rin-inse
Swish, but don't spit it; swallow it and now finish, yeah"
Eminem,"Man, I gotta be doin' (What?) somethin' right
I got eleven years of sobriety (Yeah)"
Eminem,"But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go"
Eminem,"It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'"
Eminem,"Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green"
Eminem,"Now, this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me"
Eminem,"Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)
Translation, I will probably kill us both"
Eminem,"You'll turn around and just be like, ""Man, how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?"
Eminem,"But I'm movin' on with mine, Nick, is that  your (Wife)
Well tell her to shut her mouth then I'll leave her alone"
Eminem,"I was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
And then this thought just popped in my head"
Eminem,"To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace"
Eminem,"As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in"
Eminem,"And the rappers I wish that we woulda politicked with
Maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features"
Eminem,"Give me the mic, show me where the fuckin' studio's at
When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was White"
Eminem,"Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc"
Eminem,"And it's burnin', and I have returned
And I am whatever you say I am"
Eminem,"When have I ever retreated? (Never) You never seen it
Every dream that I ever dreamt, I exceeded"
Eminem,"Getting chased, by them Jackboys, think it's 'bout to fuzz
Like a lint roller they wait 'til it's late, they will tiptoe"
Eminem,"I like a bitch that like to wobble, wobble
Shake it, shake it, break it, break it, uh"
Eminem,"Invite 'em in like a One A Day
I'm not done (Preach!)"
Eminem,"'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?"
Eminem,"So now I'm catchin' the flak from these activists when they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say ""faggot,"" shit"
Eminem,"That's what we call 'em pigsties for
They're like eyesores to police"
Eminem,"I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased"
Eminem,"Nigga, we made it, made it, they hate it, hate it
Pro professional, pure persistent, I'm paper chasing"
Eminem,"It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft turn nothin' into somethin'"
Eminem,"Good Lordy, whoadie
You must be gone off that water bottle"
Eminem,"For me, say fuck it, kick some shots back, get hammered, and nail her
These bitches tryin' to get attached, but they're failin' to latch onto the tail of"
Eminem,"You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you"
Eminem,"'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth (The roof comes off, the roof comes off)
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps ('Til my legs, until my legs)"
Eminem,"Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
And now he wants to take it out on us"" (Ooouuu)"
Eminem,"You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating"
Eminem,"""Look, there's an apple!"" — ""No, it's not, it's a peach!""
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang"
Eminem,"Pinchin' nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working"
Eminem,"Then you wonder, ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm goin', when I'm thirty"
Eminem,"I'm fed up with bein' humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings"
Eminem,"Even while sleepin', be thinkin' so woke
White Cartiers, all I'm seein' is dope (Yeah)"
Eminem,"Get your shit stole, and your lip swole, I became bitter
As I got a little bit older, my hate"
Eminem,"Woo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet"
Eminem,"See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one 'cause they think this shit's cool"
Eminem,"And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in"
Eminem,"So there's nothin' for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es"
Eminem,"Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow"
Eminem,"Even if it is, once they start to turn their backs
They ain't never comin' back in"
Eminem,"But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous"
Eminem,"I say, every day she be givin' it up
There she go, shakin' that ass on the flo'"
Eminem,"And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall"
Eminem,"Obie Trice, real name, no gimmicks
Ra—"
Eminem,"I be on my own (Yeah), head up in the clouds like Zeus
When they say, ""You ain't the GOAT"", I come down like, ""Who?"""
Eminem,"But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)"
Eminem,"'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?"
Eminem,"I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
See, the problem is, I speak to suburban kids"
Eminem,"That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis"
Eminem,"It was almost a homicide
That you caused, ‘cause I was so traumatized"
Eminem,"Like I fuckin' sit around and think about you all the time
I just think this shit is funny when I pounce you on a rhyme"
Eminem,"Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick"
Eminem,"Stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy"
Eminem,"Money ain't a thing, that ain't a thing for real (What is that?)
It's the broke lingo (Huh)"
Eminem,"I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes"
Eminem,"I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get! (Yo)
White America, I could be one of your kids"
Eminem,"Guess who's back, back again?
Shady's back, tell a friend"
Eminem,"New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, ooh-hoo"
Eminem,"Game ov' (Over), Thanos on you H-Os
On my petty shit, but I don't paint toes (Yeah)"
Eminem,"I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me"
Eminem,"But only when it freezes (Fuck)
Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?"
Eminem,"Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash?"
Eminem,"I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
I think I love you, baby, I think I love you too"
Eminem,"I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it"
Eminem,"To beat me and tries can treat me just like poison (What?)
They can eat me and die (Hehe)"
Eminem,"Fucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?
I keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'"
Eminem,"And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook
Me for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow, I'm stabbin' myself"
Eminem,"And left me with nothin' but shattered dreams
And the life we coulda had and we coulda been"
Eminem,"It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum"
Eminem,"Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see? I ain't like you"
Eminem,"But a look of disgust, I don't doubt it'd be that
As I begin to fuckin' devour the track"
Eminem,"Tryna hold on to it, 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can"
Eminem,"Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing"
Eminem,"Who would've thought standin' in this mirror, bleachin' my hair
With some peroxide, reachin' for a t-shirt to wear"
Eminem,"Ooh girl, that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab"
Eminem,"Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away"
Eminem,"Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountaintop"
Eminem,"Wasn't jokin' when I told you you take my breath away
You're a supernova and I'm a"
Eminem,"And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin'"
Eminem,"Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor"
Eminem,"Said he on the run, glued his feet to the floor
Up in my Tesla, I'm rollin' up 'Ishers, I stopped at Valero, think I should quit smokin'"
Eminem,"But I got my head in the clouds like Zeus
Swear I can see the game from a bird's-eye view, ayy"
Eminem,"When they say, ""You ain't the GOAT"", I come down like, ""Who?""
But I got my head in the clouds like Zeus"
Eminem,"You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow, little boy, you gon' learn"
Eminem,"Pinocchio and my pistol, they got the same nose
Me and my niggas gotta eat, we share the same stove (What?)"
Eminem,"So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see"
Eminem,"My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live
White boy, white boy, in your cop car"
Eminem,"So you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me"
Eminem,"You're tryin' to save me
Stop holdin' your breath"
Eminem,"More to try talkin' you into comin' up off it
I know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is"
Eminem,"Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa"
Eminem,"But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)"
Eminem,"I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones
Bacardi and Hen', never thought the party would end"
Eminem,"Do not come and speak to me
I don't know you, and, no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing"
Eminem,"But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope"
Eminem,"Yeah, they woke a giant up
So when I get back on my feet, don't wonder why in the"
Eminem,"Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent"
Eminem,"And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin"
Eminem,"For the rights that men have died for to protect?
The women and men who have broke their necks"
Eminem,"I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat"
Eminem,"I call them people (Peephole)
Because they're so easy to see through 'em (See through 'em)"
Eminem,"Let me whisper sweet nothings into your ear, boo
Now what you say? (It's nothing) Yeah, so what I'll do"
Eminem,"We may never understand each other, it's no use
We ain't ever gonna grasp what each other goes through"
Eminem,"I better stop and say my grace
From it I pray that I don't fall"
Eminem,"'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it"
Eminem,"Pray you see tomorrow, little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn"
Eminem,"Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts:
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that"
Eminem,"Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial"
Eminem,"The poster child, the motherfuckin' spokesman now, for—
White America, I could be one of your kids"
Eminem,"And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids"
Eminem,"I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up"
Eminem,"La-la, la-la-la
La-la, la-la"
Eminem,"He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said"
Eminem,"Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions"
Eminem,"Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs"
Eminem,"And I'd cry and I'd scream, ""Baby, please don't leave!""
But you left and you took everything I had left"
Eminem,"I put all of my heart and my soul in it
I met you in person, you so different"
Eminem,"Never know what kinda car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partyin' then"
Eminem,"Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day"
Eminem,"Stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy"
Eminem,"The more time goes by, the more life happens
And we gotta be men, we got responsibilities"
Eminem,"Just lay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees"
Eminem,"These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and"
Eminem,"Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no"
Eminem,"From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may"
Eminem,"A better person than I was
But I hate you (Uh), ‘cause you drained me (Uh)"
Eminem,"I just settled all my lawsuits (Fuck you, Debbie)
Now, this looks like a job for me"
Eminem,"We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man
Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that"
Eminem,"By the time they hit fourth grade they've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals"
Eminem,"But only when it freezes
(It's true—)"
Eminem,"Turn down for what?
I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up (Illa, Illa, Illa)"
Eminem,"Girl, you talkin' to a monsta, ayy
You could give your whole damn life to the music thing"
Eminem,"Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'"
Eminem,"Ooh, yeah, girl, run that game
""Hailie Jade, I love that name"
Eminem,"I bust my ass for this shit and I swear
It ain't even worth dissing someone so offbeat"
Eminem,"I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh"
Eminem,"So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?"
Eminem,"They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)"
Eminem,"'Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin' the dust
It'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what"
Eminem,"But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you"
Eminem,"I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl"
Eminem,"Then I began to explode, detonate, now the Eastside went schizo
Thought my name was B-side 'cause they flipped over my tape"
Eminem,"Wifey's on the side of me talkin' sense into me
Without she, I feel incomplete mentally, she's been sent to me"
Eminem,"'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth (The roof comes off, the roof comes off)
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps ('Til my legs, until my legs)"
Eminem,"I gave you all, you gave me none
But if you blame me (Uh), you're crazy (Uh)"
Eminem,"If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew"
Eminem,"Don't play games, it'll be dangerous if you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt, I'ma show you what it's like to hurt"
Eminem,"I'm lookin' fo' a girl I can fuck in my Hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' butt"
Eminem,"Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam; like Tommy just burst in the door"
Eminem,"Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music"
Eminem,"I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman"
Eminem,"'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?"
Eminem,"Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably"
Eminem,"Two to the one, from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good tree"
Eminem,"Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away
They wanna JonBenét me (Fuck you), I'm unaccommodating"
Eminem,"So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?"
Eminem,"This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all"
Eminem,"Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice?"
Eminem,"And bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop
Sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods"
Eminem,"So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy"
Eminem,"And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (Yeah)"
Eminem,"‘Cause I'm stronger than I was
A beautiful face is all that you have"
Eminem,"I want a bitch to sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can, but she won't say no"
Eminem,"So, pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve"
Eminem,"Have you ever loved someone so much you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for"
Eminem,"Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
Into ya, the back of it just mangled steel"
Eminem,"Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut
It's survival of what?"
Eminem,"Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do"
Eminem,"I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with bein' humble"
Eminem,"I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus"
Eminem,"Inside of my head (You're tryin' to)
You're tryin' to save me"
Eminem,"This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no word, I don't deserve it?"
Eminem,"Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie
We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up)"
Eminem,"What, you tryin' to be my new wife?
What, you Mariah? Fly through twice"
Eminem,"Shake that ass for me
I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist"
Eminem,"You could give your whole damn life to the music thing
They gon' turn around—"
Eminem,"All the carnage you left, is this the kind of karma you get
For turnin' your fuckin' back on Bizzy, Kuniva, and Swift?"
Eminem,"And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it"
Eminem,"Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm"
Eminem,"But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water"
Eminem,"I've tried hearkening back to, but I'm fightin' for air
I'm barely chartin' myself"
Eminem,"We fight back with violence but acts like that are
Black eyes on the movement"
Eminem,"'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out ('Til the roof, until the roof)
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth (The roof comes off, the roof comes off)"
Eminem,"Oye-yoy-yoy, man-oh-man, your boy-boy-boys
Gettin' sick of these girls-girls-girls, oink-oink-oink"
Eminem,"Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman"
Eminem,"'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (Argh)
'Cause they drivin' me crazy, I can't take it"
Eminem,"Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives"
Eminem,"White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live"
Eminem,"I'm done bein' your punching bag
It was November 31st today"
Eminem,"Atatiana, Rayshard, and Dominique
Eric Garner and Rodney King"
Eminem,"To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter"
Eminem,"You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you"
Eminem,"So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
If you don't stand for the national anthem"
Eminem,"V-Venomous, the thoughts spun
Like a web and you just caught in 'em"
Eminem,"And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
*Curtains closing*"
Eminem,"But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So, I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me"
Eminem,"My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers"
Eminem,"I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing"
Eminem,"Well, that's nothin'
New-hoo, ooh-hoo"
Eminem,"Here's what you say to someone you hate
My life would be so much better"
Eminem,"Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip"
Eminem,"Jaws all on the floor like Pam; like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before"
Eminem,"Yeah, we fucked—bitch, so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes"
Eminem,"It's like you put a knife through my chest
And pushed it right through to the"
Eminem,"You tryin' to flip this on me? If I spent more time with you, you say
""Okay, yeah, and I'm coo-coo, eh?"" — Well, screw you"
Eminem,"But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take?
Let's cut to the chase 'fore the door shuts in your face"
Eminem,"And whether you like to admit it (Err), I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can"
Eminem,"Used to have to sit and watch them bills pile up (Yeah)
Now I just sit back and watch them bills pile up (Haha), but"
Eminem,"Eric Garner and Rodney King
No, we can't get along 'til these white motherfuckin' cops"
Eminem,"Or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up"
Eminem,"Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners, helpless"
Eminem,"Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis"
Eminem,"Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy, just follow the beat"
Eminem,"The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em"
Eminem,"I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt"
Eminem,"You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you"
Eminem,"Pray you see tomorrow, little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn"
Eminem,"To get 'em all bent so outta shape (Fuck)
Shit, bro, hold up, wait"
Eminem,"So I know they 'bout to be pissed at me (Why?)
But this, to me, is a mystery"
Eminem,"It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—
I'm friends with the monster"
Eminem,"From the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends, it was 'bout
Bustin' raps and standin' for somethin', fuck an acronym"
Eminem,"Now I never
Wanted someone to die"
Eminem,"I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me"
Eminem,"And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm"
Eminem,"'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth (The roof comes off, the roof comes off)
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps ('Til my legs, until my legs)"
Eminem,"All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn"
Eminem,"How could I predict my words would have an impact like this?
I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office"
Eminem,"Seems like the average lifespan of a white man
Is more than twice than a black life span"
Eminem,"Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me"
Eminem,"I just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth
'Cause the truth is, the moment that Proof died, so did the group"
Eminem,"In the draft turn nothin' into somethin'
Still can make that straw into gold, chump, I will spin"
Eminem,"That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict"
Eminem,"I may never trust someone
But you won't break me"
Eminem,"Fair weather, wishy-washy
She thinks machine washed me (What?)"
Eminem,"I'm not done (Preach!)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden"
Eminem,"But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study"
Eminem,"You can call me an asshole, I'm glad
'Cause I am whatever you say I am"
Eminem,"Wanted one though, they were so dope (Yeah)
Was a have-not (Yeah) 'cause my pockets (Uh)"
Eminem,"John Manziel, odd man out (What?)
Heavyweight, word to Scott Van Pelt"
Eminem,"You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock"
Eminem,"I can describe areas of your house you wouldn't find
On an episode of Cribs, a blow below the ribs"
Eminem,"They keep wantin' me to rap responsibly
When I'm constantly passin' the buck like the fuckin' Dollar Tree"
Eminem,"But he never put no scrubs on from Snoop, K. Dot to Shady
Shady like a shadow or your silhouette, intellect, I better check to see why you feel upset"
Eminem,"Squeeze it and hold it 'cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone"
Eminem,"As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
We fight back with violence but acts like that are"
Eminem,"Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts:"
Eminem,"Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough"
Eminem,"Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me"
Eminem,"God's given me all this, still, I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded"
Eminem,"And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm"
Eminem,"I said this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me"
Eminem,"Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, durags, and a stockin' cap"
Eminem,"Bitch, you talkin' to a rap god, ayy
Girl, you talkin' to a monsta, ayy"
Eminem,"My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead (I hate you)"
Eminem,"(Come on) Sing with me (Sing), sing for the year (Sing it)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on)"
Eminem,"All this drip, think I am below sea level
Cut your own wrist off with that weak bezel"
Eminem,"All Wock', no pop, how we drop, you can come and take a baby sip, still taste that it's potent
One of one, sittin' 'round the stars, double R, finna race, yeah, the Wraith like a spaceship, it's floatin'"
Eminem,"In your back, then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
Fucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?"
Eminem,"'Til I woke up to discover that that dream was dead
But you won't break me"
Eminem,"Woulda been our anniversary
Two years, but you left on the 1st of May"
Eminem,"I feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstance
I'd rather hear 'em say ""Die N-word"" than Die Antwoord"
Eminem,"Make ladies swoon, baby, Ooh, baby! Look at my sales
Let's do the math: If I was Black, I would've sold half"
Eminem,"'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me"
Eminem,"I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' ninety on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?"
Eminem,"I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll turn around and just be like, ""Man, how the fuck"
Eminem,"It'd be so empty without me
Now, this looks like a job for me"
Eminem,"To the sixties, having black skin is risky
'Cause this keeps happening"
Eminem,"I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say"
Eminem,"They did it to Chance
Next they'll be mentionin' Future in the past tense (Yeah)"
Eminem,"Come to think about it, his name was, it was you
Damn"
Eminem,"But I pray you see tomorrow, little boy, you gon' learn
Pray you see tomorrow, little boy, you gon' learn"
Eminem,"Damn
I see Mary Ann, Mary Ann's saying cut the tape"
Eminem,"How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it"
Eminem,"Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing"
Eminem,"The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners"
Eminem,"Took it on the chin like a champ
So don't lump me in with them chump-ions"
Eminem,"But I pray you see tomorrow, little boy, you gon' learn
Pray you see tomorrow, little boy, you gon' learn"
Eminem,"Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik"
Eminem,"We touch, I feel a rush
We clutch, it isn't much"
Eminem,"Then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot
We may never understand each other, it's no use"
Eminem,"Granny told me, ""Boy, you reap what you sow""
Do the most, we over-even the score"
Eminem,"'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me"
Eminem,"But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water"
Eminem,"Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em"
Eminem,"But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was"
Eminem,"They gon' turn around—
I've seen them come and go"
Eminem,"Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares"
Eminem,"And we gotta be men, we got responsibilities
Plus we don't say how we feel"
Eminem,"Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em"
Eminem,"And we're trapped in these racial biases
That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise"
Eminem,"We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self"
Eminem,"If you want space, I hope you take your helmet off soon as you get up to Venus and choke
Even while sleepin', be thinkin' so woke"
Eminem,"But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?"
Eminem,"Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant"
Eminem,"Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit"
Eminem,"They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world (Ooh-ooh)"

And now I smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it"
Nas,"Everything you into is underworld related
You sell your man out, not even your girl is sacred"
Nas,"But I won't stop now (Uh)
'Cause I can't stop now"
Nas,"Comin' outta Queensbridge
Now, let me take a trip down memory lane"
Nas,"What dem fi know
All of mi friend dem mi salute, Daddi gon Lenny Screw"
Nas,"Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these"
Nas,"So I could get old, my flesh rot away
But that'll be the day when it's peace"
Nas,"All I need is one mic (All I ever needed in this world, fuck cash)
All I need is one mic (Fuck the cars, the jewelry)"
Nas,"Eatin' Michelin Stars, countin' a million
Dun! I let it go for the family, meetin's at Cote in Miami"
Nas,"Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I pull a number like a pager
‘Cause I'ma ace when I face the bass"
Nas,"Her mother cried when she answered
Said she don't know what got inside this child's mind, she planted"
Nas,"Headed for Delaware with one change of gear
Nothin' on my mind but the dime sack we blazed"
Nas,"Serving up a fix
The world is an addiction"
Nas,"Grabbed her face, say goodbye to your undercover friend
One between the eye, she's died, by mistake"
Nas,"You like 'em thug style, link rocking, then mink copping
Hit you on the sink, a hundred dollar drink popping"
Nas,"I'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ"
Nas,"And if he can be the shinin' beacon this side of the G.W.B and
Shine a light when it's gray out?"
Nas,"Talkin' about, ""I'm fucked up,"" ""I got to get on,"" ""I got to-""
""I'm in the grind,"" ""I'm fucked up"""
Nas,"Can't hang with these little niggas, they're killing, they're reckless
Wish I could build with him, but will he change, really?"
Nas,"Oh, you ain't know how many O's in the bankroll?
Sort of like the game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"
Nas,"Just a good kid, he wasn't that guy
Had a little hit, he wasn't that high"
Nas,"The kings is back, time to return the crown (Hey, hey, hey, hey!)
Who want it? Tuck your chain when dude comin'"
Nas,"And I bought you diamonds even though I got a heart of gold
And on your enemies, we rode, I go Picasso, Art of War"
Nas,"This is our last and final goodbye
Goodbye"
Nas,"Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin
Yo, fuck, rap is real, watch the herbs stand still"
Nas,"Just to remind me, just to inspire me
To stay focused, it's a real sick society"
Nas,"I dropped out of Cooley High, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
Jungle survivor, fuck who's the live-r"
Nas,"Raw though, an ounce mixed with leak, that's pure though
Flippin' the bigger picture"
Nas,"Naw, yeah... (My book of rhymes)
I'm tellin' you, I'ma come up with some new shit now"
Nas,"QB
Where the fuck y'all at?"
Nas,"Last time you wrote, you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain, when you come home, the corner's ours"
Nas,"We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in Marcy
The gods — they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi"
Nas,"My owner fell to the floor, his wig split
So fast, I didn't know he was hit, it's over wit'!"
Nas,"Designer clothes, lacin' your clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holdin' dough, no parole, no rubbers"
Nas,"Keeps me blasted and starts talkin' mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him"
Nas,"Diamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes
Movin' with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight"
Nas,"And God, your young soldier's not sober but needs you
This world's my home, but world, I will leave you"
Nas,"But I'm a righteous son, despite I'm in the midst of
Dudes who switch up and change"
Nas,"Gimme the key back, baby
I want your love back, baby, oh"
Nas,"Fuckin' with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?"
Nas,"You know he showin' his bling out
She got in the car, he drove, he pulled his thing out"
Nas,"Give me that land you owe me so I can roam
So when you trespass, blaow, one in your dome"
Nas,"Only conclusion is shooting, bullets popping, hoodlums dropping
Fear any day that the Feds will come knocking"
Nas,"Bitch tried to slam the door shut, got caught in Horse foot
Shot the Spanish kid in the rib, drug him in"
Nas,"Colombians created crack, the government made stacks (Welcome to America, niggas!)
Reagan had Alzheimer's, that's true"
Nas,"Everybody sound the same, commercialize the game
Reminiscing when it wasn't all business"
Nas,"But she thought she could've found a new guy
That kid alright, but I'm her kryptonite, a different type"
Nas,"The root of evil strikes again, this could sting
Now the team got beef, between the Post and the Point"
Nas,"Secret indictments, adds on the one seeking enlightenment
My Movado says 7 — the God hour, that's if you follow"
Nas,"Hit the gym, hit the scales, heaven-sent but negligent (So fine..)
To see ya prophecy, your ebony tone is locking me"
Nas,"So from infant to geriatric, trust your own judgment
Live with it and love it"
Nas,"Made a change, the pants-sagger put plans in action
To lay claim the Pan-African made it happen"
Nas,"I would change everything, oh yeah
From the birth of a child, the world is foul"
Nas,"Even if I'm in the right, 'cause still a life is a life
What was it worth to see you covered in dirt?"
Nas,"Spent twenty on a bad bitch I hardly know
New girl every night, two girls was every other night"
Nas,"Messing with my mind, emotional thangs (Messing with my mind)
(And there goes.. a black girl.. lost)"
Nas,"So ""Untitled"" it is
I never change nothin', but people remember this"
Nas,"‘Cause in my physical I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong"
Nas,"Yo, sit back, relax, catch your contact, sip your Cognac
And let's all wash this money through this laundromat"
Nas,"I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded"
Nas,"So they say (The bridge is over, the bridge is over)
Nah, this is the time we destroy and rebuild it"
Nas,"Hope I don't catch a hommo, grossing our net
Simultaneously making me climb higher"
Nas,"‘Cause I'ma ace when I face the bass
40-side is the place that is givin' me grace"
Nas,"On how my long dick stretch your insides
For real, ma, with your thick lips and thick thighs"
Nas,"Like it never happened, then later we at that Heat game
Just another day in the life, of two people in love"
Nas,"That's ill behavior, want the whip matted
Want her ass the fattest, beat it: Thriller jacket"
Nas,"And the years them carry on and I miss you even more
Still I send them go to school and tell them"
Nas,"Making me kill, but what I feel, it never mattered
When I'm empty, I'm quiet, finding myself fiending to be fired"
Nas,"Bunch of triple-cross niggas, just New York niggas
Lift you off your feet when they was just talkin' with you"
Nas,"You never knew how to make dollars
You couldn't make orders at a drive-through McDonald's"
Nas,"Thinkin' I'ma lose it, my mom's in chemo
Three times a week yo, keep tryin', but people, it's hard"
Nas,"Through your existence become wealthy, Knowledge Is King
Pimps and card sharks, thieves"
Nas,"32 grams raw, chop it in half, get 16, double it, times 3
We got 48, which mean a whole lot of C.R.E.A.M"
Nas,"No friends and no family to catch my fall
Runnin' on empty, th'was nothin' left in me but doubt"
Nas,"Young girl struggling, trying to survive (Trying to survive)
Mother of the Earth, she made you and I"
Nas,"Fresh face, NY plates, got a crooked eye for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes"
Nas,"Tight with him, why was he in the way?
Why was he standing next to the enemy that specific day?"
Nas,"New York state of mind
Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TEC's"
Nas,"That's just a warm up
‘Cause I can– on anybody, anybody"
Nas,"No fun, 'cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold they breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death"
Nas,"You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catchin' the Jungle Fever"
Nas,"Where them niggas I shouted out on my first shit?
Bo cooking blow, fuck is Slate at? Where Turkey went?"
Nas,"If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)"
Nas,"And wounded them housing scheme, nah mean?
Nuff a dem a move sideway and lean, nah mean?"
Nas,"She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins"
Nas,"Cristal, blowin' dub sacks
That's when it all just hit me: you see, the broads and Bentleys"
Nas,"It's a ugly nation, cops circle the block with mug shots
Photograph pictures of suspect faces"
Nas,"We can drive through the city, no doubt
But don't say my car's topless – say the titties is out"
Nas,"Uhh, rest in peace to Black Just
Riding through Jamaica Queens in his black truck"
Nas,"We can watch the tape, play back and just zone
Film all the bitches, on the benches with ill extensions"
Nas,"So if her husband is a gangster, can't be mad, I'll love him
Never, for her I want better, homie in jail – dead that"
Nas,"Bust the problems of the world today
(It's yours)"
Nas,"Who are you niggas? Why argue niggas?
The truth is the truth, I really put my scars on niggas"
Nas,"She be leavin', still I smell of eau de parfum
She can't run 'cause I got Cinderella's right shoe"
Nas,"No friends and no family to catch my fall
Runnin' on empty, there was nothin' left in me but doubt"
Nas,"With side bets, so roll a deuce, nothin' below
(Peace, God) Peace, God, now the shit is explained"
Nas,"Is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen"
Nas,"Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!
Some niggas fuck their enemies in their ass when they catch 'em"
Nas,"Hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death"
Nas,"As long as I enjoy the fruit, yeah
Adam and Eve don't fall too far from the apple tree"
Nas,"You can be easily recruited, you’re heaven-sent
Your smile put me at ease"
Nas,"We did it big and they bigots, they'd rather shoot than write tickets
What it feel like to go get it? What it feel like to go miss it?"
Nas,"Reef and Matty C offered me a little money
Shit a little funny, feel a little laughter"
Nas,"I guess that makes me a hero
This universal apartheid, I'm hog-tied, the corporate side"
Nas,"Ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned, they should be burned, it is poison"
Nas,"I wanna crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for Black Power, 'cause all we want is his freedom"
Nas,"You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin (Uh)
Streets are full of 'em, read the bulletin (Uh)"
Nas,"Candid shit only
Scared motherfuckers"
Nas,"Get it right, you only have one first chance
To make one first impression that lasts a lifetime"
Nas,"This hurricane in my brain is the burden I bear
I can do without, I'm here (I'm here)"
Nas,"Plus the people need someone to believe in (Yes)
So in God's Son we trust"
Nas,"I chill wit' niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam made a dread scream and sprayed a Fed team"
Nas,"From day to night, I play the mic, and you'll thank God

Nas,"Don't hate me, hate the money I see (Yeah), clothes that I buy (Uh-huh)
Ice that I wear, flows that I try (C'mon)"
Nas,"Invade my personal life? Out of the question
What are they expectin'?"
Nas,"What are they expectin'?

Nas,"When I was 12, I went to...
And you're sitting at home doing this shit"
Nas,"And let you niggas stop me now?
