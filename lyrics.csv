Drake,meetin all my heroes like seein how magic works

Eminem,sometimes i feel like all i ever do is
Eminem,find different ways to word the same old song
Eminem,ever since i came along
Eminem,from the day the song called hi my name is dropped
Eminem,started thinking my name was fault
Eminem,cause any time things went wrong
Eminem,i was the one who they would blame it on
Eminem,the media made me the equivalent
Eminem,of a modernday genghis khan
Eminem,tried to argue it was only entertainment dog
Eminem,gangster nah courageous balls
Eminem,had to change my style they said im way too soft
Eminem,and i sound like az and nas out came the claws
Eminem,and the fangs been out since then
Eminem,but up until the instant that i went against it
Eminem,it was ingrained in me
Eminem,that i wouldnt amount to a shit stain i thought
Eminem,no wonder i had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
Eminem,do i really belong in this game i pondered
Eminem,i just wanna play my part
Eminem,should i make waves or not
Eminem,so back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
Eminem,and i dont wanna seem ungrateful
Eminem,or disrespect the art form i was raised upon
Eminem,but sometimes you gotta take a loss
Eminem,and have people rub it in your face
Eminem,before you get made pissed off
Eminem,and keep plugging its your only outlet
Eminem,and your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
Eminem,better find a way to counter it quick and make it ah
Eminem,feel like ive already said this a kabillion 80 times
Eminem,how many times can i say the same thing
Eminem,different ways that rhyme
Eminem,what i really wanna say is if theres anyone else that can relate to my story bet you feel the same way i felt
Eminem,when i was in the same place you are when i was afraid to
Eminem,i was a afraid to make a single sound
Eminem,afraid i would never find a way out out out
Eminem,afraid id never be found 
Eminem,i didnt wanna go another round 
Eminem,an angry mans power will shut you up 
Eminem,trip wires fill this house with tiptoed love
Eminem,run out of excuses for everyone

Eminem,i let you keep me down 
Eminem,guts over fear guts over fear
Eminem,feels like a close its coming to
Eminem,fuck am i gonna do
Eminem,its too late to start over
Eminem,this is the only thing i thing i know
Eminem,i know what it was like i was there once
Eminem,single parents hate your appearance
Eminem,as you struggle to find your place in this world
Eminem,and the pain spawns all the anger on
Eminem,but it wasnt til i put the pain in song
Eminem,learned who to aim it on that i made a spark
Eminem,started to spit harder shit
Eminem,learned how to harness it while the reins were off
Eminem,and there was a lot of bizarre shit but the crazy part
Eminem,was soon as i stopped saying i gave a fuck
Eminem,haters started to appreciate my art
Eminem,and it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain i caused
Eminem,but what am i gonna do when the rage is gone
Eminem,and the lights go out in that trailer park oh
Eminem,and the window is closing and theres nowhere else that i can go with flows and im frozen
Eminem,cause theres no more emotion for me to pull from
Eminem,just a bunch of playful songs that i make for fun
Eminem,so to the break of dawn here i go recycling the same old song
Eminem,but id rather make not afraid 2
Eminem,than make another motherfucking we made you ah
Eminem,now i dont wanna seem indulgent
Eminem,when i discuss my lows and my highs
Eminem,my demise and my uprise pray to god
Eminem,i just open enough eyes later on
Eminem,and gave you the supplies and the tools
Eminem,to hopefully use thatll make you strong
Eminem,enough to lift yourself up when you feel like i felt
Eminem,cause i cant explain to yall how dang exhausted my legs felt
Eminem,just having to balance my dang self
Eminem,when on eggshells i was made to walk
Eminem,but thank you ma cause that gave me the
Eminem,strength to cause shadymania so when they empty that stadium
Eminem,least i made it out of that house
Eminem,and found a place in this world when the day was done
Eminem,so this is for every kid who alls they ever did
Eminem,was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
Eminem,i represent him or her anyone similar
Eminem,you are the reason that i made this song
Eminem,and everything youre scared to say

Eminem,feels like were stuck in a time warp to me
Eminem,as i kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
Eminem,as this beat backspins its like were drifting back in
Eminem,to the sixties having black skin is risky
Eminem,cause this keeps happening
Eminem,throughout history africanamericans have been treated like shit
Eminem,and i admit there have been times where its been embarrassin to be a
Eminem,white boy white boy youre a rockstar
Eminem,my momma talkin to me tryna tell me how to live
Eminem,white boy white boy in your cop car
Eminem,but i dont listen to her cause my head is like a sieve
Eminem,white boy white boy youre untouchable
Eminem,the worlds coming to an end i dont even care
Eminem,nobody can tell me shit cause im a big rockstar
Eminem,seems like the average lifespan of a white man
Eminem,is more than twice than a black life span
Eminem,i wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
Eminem,i feel like checking out on life cant escape this circumstance
Eminem,id rather hear em say die nword than die antwoord
Eminem,ninja now its better disguised banter
Eminem,but thats life strapped cause were strapped financially
Eminem,and cant find answers
Eminem,were applying but mcdonalds
Eminem,seems to be the only franchise thatll hire
Eminem,so how can we have higher standards
Eminem,as dallas overshadows the battle for black lives matter
Eminem,we fight back with violence but acts like that are
Eminem,black eyes on the movement
Eminem,which makes black lives madder
Eminem,at cops and cops madder
Eminem,thats why its at a stalemate
Eminem,and cant arrive at a compromise so its black ops
Eminem,i wonder if we hire more black cops the crap stops
Eminem,the block is our backyards officers not the crack spot
Eminem,call the attack dogs off of us man
Eminem,you always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
Eminem,and bad cops fuck it up for the good cops and man stop
Eminem,sendin white cops in the black neighborhoods
Eminem,who aint acclimated to em like thats the way to do it

Eminem,and know nobody black so they act afraid of us
Eminem,and thats racism the fear that a black face gives em
Eminem,a subconscious racist
Eminem,wait why are there black neighborhoods
Eminem,cause america segregated us designated us to an area
Eminem,separated us sectioneightd us
Eminem,when we tear it ups the only time attentions paid to us
Eminem,and education sucks and every days another
Eminem,freddie gray for us a levy breaks or fuzz
Eminem,why is it they treat us like dryer lint
Eminem,we just want a safe environment for our kids
Eminem,but cant escape the sirens
Eminem,dont take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
Eminem,the poverty that we face so the crime rates the highest in
Eminem,the lowest classes its like a razor wire fence
Eminem,and were trapped in these racial biases
Eminem,that plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
Eminem,every time we see a devils face
Eminem,lions tigers and bears oh my
Eminem,its more like billy clubs and gats
Eminem,and we really love it when you think were guilty cause were black
Eminem,but you kill each other facts
Eminem,you peel each others caps for silly stuff like hats
Eminem,single mother strugglin through substance abuse
Eminem,while people with nothin to lose shoot each other for shoes
Eminem,fuck your republican views
Eminem,pull ourselves up by our bootstraps where the fuck are the boots
Eminem,and streets act as a narrator dont gotta read comics
Eminem,or be that into characters just to see that just to be black
Eminem,you better be strapped with a derringer
Eminem,or be capped in america like steve rogers
Eminem,cause no one oversees these cops and
Eminem,all we see is em beat charges
Eminem,we done seen em beat rodney king unconscious and got off
Eminem,so we dont need all you crooked police officers peace offerings
Eminem,just keep marchin til we reach congress
Eminem,but theyre gonna say youre tryin to take an irrational stance
Eminem,if you try to slander the flag but
Eminem,somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
Eminem,so they call it a kaepernick tantrum
Eminem,if you dont stand for the national anthem
Eminem,we raise it you better praise it
Eminem,or youll be made to feel like a traitor well
Eminem,treat you like rodney dangerfield
Eminem,home of the brave is still racist ville
Eminem,so this whole nation feels like a plantation field

Eminem,yeah yeah yeah yeah
Eminem,its 2002 everything was totally new
Eminem,we were globally huge watchin sales go through the roof
Eminem,we wrote and we feuded runyon avenue soldiers included
Eminem,a multitude of homies who would pounce for no good excuse
Eminem,we were so bulletproofwrote souped and soaked in our youth
Eminem,thought we was runnin shit til we lost the sole of our shoe
Eminem,the death of doody broke us in two
Eminem,we were thrown for a loop aint none of us know what to do
Eminem,and at the time i was goin through my own struggles too
Eminem,so i wasnt in no condition to be coachin us through
Eminem,everyone tried to go solo really nobody blew
Eminem,i was hopin they do so i aint have to shoulder the crew
Eminem,the plan was put everyone in position so that they knew
Eminem,how to stand on their own and i dont wanna open up wounds
Eminem,i just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth
Eminem,cause the truth is the moment that proof died so did the group
Eminem,shoot
Eminem,if i could leave this all behind
Eminem,i could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Eminem,down to the river with you
Eminem,help me leave this all behind
Eminem,ima wash away my sins
Eminem,ima rinse away this dirt
Eminem,i forgot to make amends
Eminem,to all the friends i may have hurt
Eminem,i better stop and say my grace
Eminem,from it i pray that i dont fall
Eminem,cause on the way back down i may
Eminem,end up runnin back into them all
Eminem,i never meant to use you all as my stepping stones
Eminem,it was never the same and its bothered me since
Eminem,and the farther we drift apart the more awkward it gets
Eminem,the more time goes by the more life happens
Eminem,and we gotta be men we got responsibilities
Eminem,plus we dont say how we feel
Eminem,and i feel like this is what got us in the debacle were in
Eminem,been with you guys thick and thin
Eminem,but its almost as if sometimes were not even friends
Eminem,which reminded me biz rockstar was the shit
Eminem,yall coulda got you a hit without me on the shit
Eminem,if youda put d12 on it wish i coulda did
Eminem,porter tried talkin you into comin up off it
Eminem,i know it wasnt my fault but part of it probably is
Eminem,i think of all of the trips to bet
Eminem,and the rappers i wish that we woulda politicked with
Eminem,maybe yall coulda clicked and got you some features
Eminem,but thats water under the bridge
Eminem,but im washin my sins in it til my conscience is cleansed
Eminem,if i could leave this all behind
Eminem,i could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Eminem,down to the river with you
Eminem,help me leave this all behind
Eminem,ima wash away my sins
Eminem,ima rinse away this dirt
Eminem,i forgot to make amends
Eminem,to all the friends i may have hurt
Eminem,i better stop and say my grace
Eminem,from it i pray that i dont fall
Eminem,cause on the way back down i may
Eminem,end up runnin back into them all
Eminem,i never meant to use you all as my stepping stones
Eminem,bacardi and hen never thought the party would end
Eminem,one minute youre bodyin shit but then your audience splits
Eminem,you can already sense the climate is startin to shift
Eminem,to these kids you no longer exist
Eminem,went from rainin cats and dogs in this bitch
Eminem,to tiny drops little drips
Eminem,and by the time your reign is over youll hardly be missed
Eminem,you start thinkin of all the artists you dissed
Eminem,all the carnage you left is this the kind of karma you get
Eminem,for turnin your fuckin back on bizzy kuniva and swift
Eminem,a freudian slip subconsciously i honestly wished
Eminem,i aint feel so much guilt and yall didnt harbor resentment
Eminem,but its hard to pretend that yall aint got none
Eminem,i just wish i had words but i guess there just are none for this
Eminem,to my partners i cant say how sorry i am
Eminem,this is not how i planned for our story to end
Eminem,i love all of you men
Eminem,but i just cant be the guy everybody depends
Eminem,on for entire careers cause thats not even fair
Eminem,i will always be here but that spark isnt there
Eminem,and i dont know how to recapture that time and that era
Eminem,ive tried hearkening back to but im fightin for air
Eminem,im barely chartin myself
Eminem,feels like im on the descent but it was not my intent
Eminem,to treat yall like a stepping stone
Eminem,though i aint left no one behind but we been down every road
Eminem,done all we possibly can i know we kept our hopes up
Eminem,but the longer we spend livin this lie that we live
Eminem,the less is left for closure so lets let this go
Eminem,its not goodbye to our friendship but d12 is over
Eminem,ima wash away my sins
Eminem,ima rinse away this dirt
Eminem,i forgot to make amends
Eminem,to all the friends i may have hurt

Kendrick Lamar,the evils of lucy was all around me
Kendrick Lamar,so i went running for answers
Kendrick Lamar,until i came home
Kendrick Lamar,but that didnt stop survivors guilt
Kendrick Lamar,going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes i earned
Kendrick Lamar,or maybe how a1 my foundation was
Kendrick Lamar,but while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city
Kendrick Lamar,i was entering a new one
Kendrick Lamar,a war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Kendrick Lamar,made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what i learned
Kendrick Lamar,the word was respect
Kendrick Lamar,just because you wore a different gang color than mines
Kendrick Lamar,doesnt mean i cant respect you as a black man
Kendrick Lamar,forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
Kendrick Lamar,if i respect you we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
Kendrick Lamar,but i dont know im no mortal man
Kendrick Lamar,maybe im just another nigga
Kendrick Lamar,shit and thats all i wrote
Kendrick Lamar,i was gonna call it another nigga but it aint really a poem
Kendrick Lamar,i just felt like its something you probably could relate to
Kendrick Lamar,other than that now that i finally got a chance to holla at you

Kendrick Lamar,damn
Kendrick Lamar,i wanted to read one last thing to you
Kendrick Lamar,its actually something a good friend had wrote
Kendrick Lamar,describing my world it says
Kendrick Lamar,the caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
Kendrick Lamar,its only job is to eat or consume everything around it
Kendrick Lamar,in order to protect itself from this mad city
Kendrick Lamar,while consuming its environment
Kendrick Lamar,the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
Kendrick Lamar,one thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him
Kendrick Lamar,but praises the butterfly
Kendrick Lamar,the butterfly represents the talent the thoughtfulness
Kendrick Lamar,and the beauty within the caterpillar
Kendrick Lamar,but having a harsh outlook on life
Kendrick Lamar,the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak
Kendrick Lamar,and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
Kendrick Lamar,already surrounded by this mad city
Kendrick Lamar,the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon
Kendrick Lamar,which institutionalizes him
Kendrick Lamar,he can no longer see past his own thoughts
Kendrick Lamar,hes trapped
Kendrick Lamar,when trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root such as
Kendrick Lamar,going home and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
Kendrick Lamar,the result
Kendrick Lamar,wings begin to emerge breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
Kendrick Lamar,finally free the butterfly sheds light on situations
Kendrick Lamar,that the caterpillar never considered ending the internal struggle
Kendrick Lamar,although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different
Kendrick Lamar,they are one and the same

Kendrick Lamar,she wasnt gay she ate pussy and that was the difference

Kendrick Lamar,changed his gender before bruce jenner was certain
Kendrick Lamar,living his truth even if it meant see a surgeon
Kendrick Lamar,we didnt talk for a while he seemed more distant
Kendrick Lamar,wasnt comfortable around me everything was offensive
Kendrick Lamar,but i recall we both had a sick sense of humor
Kendrick Lamar,made raw but time changes all
Kendrick Lamar,demetrius is maryann now
Kendrick Lamar,remember church easter sunday
Kendrick Lamar,i sat in the pew you had stronger faith
Kendrick Lamar,more spiritual when these dudes were living life straight
Kendrick Lamar,which i found ironic cause the pastor didnt see him the same
Kendrick Lamar,he said my cousin was going through some things
Kendrick Lamar,he promised the world we living in was an act on abomination
Kendrick Lamar,and demetrius was to blame
Kendrick Lamar,i knew you was conflicted by the feelings of preacherman
Kendrick Lamar,wondering if god still call you a decent man
Kendrick Lamar,still you found the courage to be subservient just to anoint
Kendrick Lamar,until he singled you out to prove his point saying
Kendrick Lamar,demetrius is maryann now
Kendrick Lamar,church his auntie is a man now it hurt
Kendrick Lamar,you the most cause your belief was close to his words
Kendrick Lamar,forcing me to stand now
Kendrick Lamar,i said mr preacherman should we love thy neighbor
Kendrick Lamar,the laws of the land or the heart whats greater
Kendrick Lamar,i recognize the study she was taught since birth
Kendrick Lamar,but that dont justify the feelings that my cousin preserved
Kendrick Lamar,the building was thinking out loud bad angel
Kendrick Lamar,thats when you looked at me and smiled said thank you
Kendrick Lamar,the day i chose humanity over religion
Kendrick Lamar,the family got closer it was all forgiven
Kendrick Lamar,i said them fbombs i aint know any better
Kendrick Lamar,mistakenly i aint think that youd know any different
Kendrick Lamar,see i was taught words was nothing more than a sound
Kendrick Lamar,if ever they was pronounced without any intentions
Kendrick Lamar,the very second you challenged the shit i was kicking
Kendrick Lamar,reminded me about a show i did out the city
Kendrick Lamar,that time i brung a fan on stage to rap
Kendrick Lamar,but disapproved the word that she couldnt say with me
Kendrick Lamar,you said kendrick aint no room for contradiction
Kendrick Lamar,to truly understand love switch position
